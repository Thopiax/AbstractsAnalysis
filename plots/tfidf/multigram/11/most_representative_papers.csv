This transition from physical products to PSSs calls for new ways of working, for example in the product development process. However, so far only limited attention has been put on capabilities needed to succeed with PSS innovation in the very early development phases - often referred to as the fuzzy front end (FFE). This article, therefore, has a dual aim: first, to further our understanding of capabilities for PSS innovation in the FFE, and second, to determine how these capabilities are linked to PSS innovation capabilities needed in subsequent development phases. Empirical data were collected from an ongoing industrial project developing an innovative PSS offering in a large manufacturing company. Individuals connected to the project reported major challenges, both experienced in the FFE and anticipated in later phases, which provided valuable information regarding capabilities needed to succeed with the endeavour.  reveal four links of PSS innovation capabilities: (1) adapting vocabulary and mental models to PSS, (2) handling the 'intangible aspect', (3) bridging organisational structures, and (4) managing new business models. PSS innovation capabilities in the FFE are also found to be of higher order (dynamic) compared to capabilities in later development phases. "

Using two case studies set in mental health services, this article explores how both culture and performance may be viewed as emergent properties of service design configurations. Thus central to ideas of service re-design should be notions of service users as the co-producers (with staff) of both organizational culture and organizational performance, as well as a clearer understanding of how such co-production processes are modulated by specific design configurations.

Service design should be a high emphasis in businesses because more is needed to reflect its key role in modern day economics. Not too many people can recall when superior customer service was experienced firsthand. Services are delivered from firms selling products and services to consumers, government agencies, non-profits, and other businesses. The operations in these organizations varies widely, but common elements allow us to study the process used in service organizations in seeing what can be done to improve customer service. The service process design is essential to better service delivery, and this report expands the discussion into dimensions of customer service like customer contact and domains of service product offerings, service guarantees, and key roles played by employees in customer service delivery being made by various organizations (Schroeder, 2008). In the present research we examine customer service among healthcare entrepreneurs operating in Poland, Russia, and the USA. It is found that personality impacts customer service levels the most in the USA (R2 = .299, N =873) followed closely by Russia (R2 = .265, N = 282), and then Poland (R2 = .257, N = 201). Suggestions for future research are provided. "

One reason may be that much of what is being said about innovation contributes to misunderstanding. To truly manifest innovation and reap its benefits, one must recognize that innovation is three different things: innovation is an outcome, innovation is a process, and innovation is a mindset. Innovation as an outcome emphasizes what output is sought, including product innovation, process innovation, marketing innovation, business model innovation, supply chain innovation, and organizational innovation. Innovation as a process attends to the way in which innovation should be organized so that outcomes can come to fruition; this includes an overall innovation process and a new product development process. Innovation as a mindset addresses the internalization of innovation by individual members of the organization where innovation is instilled and ingrained along with the creation of a supportive organizational culture that allows innovation to flourish. Such an understanding defines necessary elements, considerations, and vernacular surrounding the term so that better decisions can be made, thereby enabling innovation and having a greater propensity to succeed.

The paper explores the potential impact of an integrated service quality system on the service experience. A conceptual model is presented, accompanied by a detailed development of the hypotheses. Two samples (Study 1: n=474, Study 2: n=225) of consumers are used to empirically test the proposed model. The analysis reveals the impact a technical system has on employees’ inherent abilities (i.e. the social system), which, in turn, affect the overall assessment by customers. Additionally, the situation in which an employee works (i.e. operating environmental conditions) results in differences in the model. This paper’s main implication is this paper employs established theory to develop a model that is empirically tested to show that implementing and maintaining a quality-oriented service system can positively influence the overall customer experience. The limitations are based primarily on the methodology in which individual employees assessed all aspects of both the social and technical systems. Managers should be diligent in their design and implementation of the quality components as these affect the work setting in which employees operate.Prior research has neither explored an integrated service quality system’s impact on the service experience nor employed an established theoretical framework. This work accomplishes both with the results providing contributions to both theory and practice.   "

Management Science, 59(1), 17-35.","We study the online market for peer-to-peer (P2P) lending, in which individuals bid on unsecured microloans sought by other individual borrowers. Using a large sample of consummated and failed listings from the largest online P2P lending marketplace, Prosper.com, we find that the online friendships of borrowers act as signals of credit quality. Friendships increase the probability of successful funding, lower interest rates on funded loans, and are associated with lower ex post default rates. The economic effects of friendships show a striking gradation based on the roles and identities of the friends. We discuss the implications of our findings for the disintermediation of financial markets and the design of decentralized electronic markets."

By providing real-time information about current and predicted health of a product in the field, remote monitoring technology can mitigate some of those risks. Although recognised as one of the key enablers of servitization, the mainstream servitization research community has shown very little interest in this topic. The aim is to identify and critically analyse relevant research addressing the topic of remote monitoring technology and servitization and, based on this analysis, propose an agenda to guide future research in this area. The methodology adopted is literature review consisting of three steps: define and research questions, select keywords and databases, and identify and analyse relevant papers. Ten  have been made, which characterise current state of research under categories of examples, benefits, and challenges of using remote monitoring technology to support servitized strategies. Several areas that call for further research are suggested, but general impression is that the understanding about the role and contribution of remote monitoring technology in service delivery and strategy is still in its infancy and much greater effort will have to be invested to change this. It is also suggested that this technology holds a great potential for service and business model innovation; hence, more research is needed to further the knowledge about these topics. This paper qualifies as the first attempt to consolidate and analyse relevant research at the intersection of servitization and remote monitoring technology. "

Production and Operations Management, 26(8), 1427-1443.","In this paper, we study quality?of?service (QoS) based pricing schemes that serve as incentive mechanisms to induce sharing behaviors in Peer?to?Peer (P2P) networks. We incorporate operational QoS metrics into users’ utility functions and demonstrate how they affect individual users’ content sharing decisions. Using a game?theoretic model, our study reveals how organizations respond to the changes of operational QoS metrics in their design of pricing schemes for various business objectives at different stages of network evolution. Our results show that a higher upload capacity can foster rational sharing to start when the network is small; however, it also discourages sharing behaviors when the network becomes large. In order to induce a socially optimal behavior, a pricing scheme will not charge users for requesting content while compensating them for sharing content. Such compensation is found to increase faster with the network size when the network is large. In order to maximize the profit of a monopolistic provider, however, a pricing scheme will charge content requests with a positive price while providing less compensation to sharing users compared to the socially optimal scheme. When the network size is small, such compensation can be even negative, which implies that a monopolistic provider discourages content sharing when the network is small, but encourages it when the network becomes larger. In addition, we find that more information about peer upload capacity discourages peers to share."

An empirical, explorative case study of an innovative service system is carried out using a narrative approach and presented in the form of a saga. Insights gleaned from the empirical study are used for conceptual developments. Analysis of the empirical case study is presented as four lessons linked to values, brands, service systems and experience rooms. The paper extends a conceptual framework of innovative resource integration in service ecosystems. The paper also contributes four propositions to inform theory: values resonance is a basis for service innovation, the innovative integration of brands based on values resonance can foster innovation, the integration of resources across service system boundaries grounded in values resonance can enable innovation and the integration of experience rooms into a coherent servicescape based on values resonance can support novel forms of resource integration and value co-creation efforts in service ecosystems.

This study analyses 13,322 companies in the Japanese manufacturing industry and finds that servitisation contributes to their profitability. The major difference between servitisation companies and others is that the former sell products to end consumers. We examine two case studies of companies which have built mechanisms to facilitate continuous service provision. "

The literature argues that ExS design should be a research priority in this experience economy, yet little is known on how to articulate ExSs in their design. This paper proposes a tool called Experience Design Board for visualizing an ExS delivery process as a basis for its analysis and design. The tool is a matrix-shaped board where the key factors of experience creation in ExS (namely, servicescape, frontstage employees, other customers, backstage employees, and technology support systems) are represented in rows, and the customer experience phases are placed in columns. The tool is useful in analyzing and designing how the key factors of ExS create customer experience. The tool integrates several work streams within the evolving ExS literature into its structure and is generic enough to accommodate various ExSs in physical and digital experience contexts. By visualizing an ExS delivery process from beginning to end, the designer can obtain a systematic understanding of the essential attributes of ExS and can use it for an effective design. This tool would serve as a basis for service design in this experience economy. We live in an ""experience economy"". • A key deliverable of this economy is experience-centric service (ExS). • This paper proposes a tool called Experience Design Board for ExS visualization and design. • The tool is useful in analyzing and designing key factors of experience creation in an ExS. • The tool would serve as a basis for service design in this experience economy.
