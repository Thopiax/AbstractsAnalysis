Management Science, 62(6), 1554-1577.","This paper examines the performance of new online lending markets that rely on nonexpert individuals to screen their peers’ creditworthiness. We find that these peer lenders predict an individual’s likelihood of defaulting on a loan with 45% greater accuracy than the borrower’s exact credit score (unobserved by the lenders, who only see a credit category). Moreover, peer lenders achieve 87% of the predictive power of an econometrician who observes all standard financial information about borrowers. Screening through soft or nonstandard information is relatively more important when evaluating lower-quality borrowers. Our results highlight how aggregating over the views of peers and leveraging nonstandard information can enhance lending efficiency."

One reason may be that much of what is being said about innovation contributes to misunderstanding. To truly manifest innovation and reap its benefits, one must recognize that innovation is three different things: innovation is an outcome, innovation is a process, and innovation is a mindset. Innovation as an outcome emphasizes what output is sought, including product innovation, process innovation, marketing innovation, business model innovation, supply chain innovation, and organizational innovation. Innovation as a process attends to the way in which innovation should be organized so that outcomes can come to fruition; this includes an overall innovation process and a new product development process. Innovation as a mindset addresses the internalization of innovation by individual members of the organization where innovation is instilled and ingrained along with the creation of a supportive organizational culture that allows innovation to flourish. Such an understanding defines necessary elements, considerations, and vernacular surrounding the term so that better decisions can be made, thereby enabling innovation and having a greater propensity to succeed.

Using a relational view of the firm, the authors propose that there are three main business dimensions that product companies have to manage in servitization and that the support of service suppliers can moderate the effects of these dimensions on the benefits obtained from the product–service system (PSS) delivered. To test these hypotheses, the authors perform a cross-sectional quantitative survey in 104 Brazilian and Italian product companies. The  show that the three business dimensions are important for servitization while there is a trade-off decision regarding service suppliers' support since suppliers act differently depending on the PSS orientation (product- or service-oriented). The work is limited to the analysis of what should change in a company during servitization and the impact of supplier's support. Further research is needed to complement this study by analyzing the process and context of the organizational change. The research contributes an understanding about how the benefits practitioners can obtain from servitization are strongly influenced by the support of service suppliers and how this influence depends on the PSS orientation of the product company. This is one of the first quantitative studies to provide evidence of how service suppliers' involvement affects different servitization business dimensions and the obtained benefits for both product- and service-oriented outputs.

Service science combines organization and human understanding with business and technological understanding to categorize and explain service systems, including how they interact and evolve to cocreate value. Our goal is to apply a scientific approach to advance design and innovation in service systems. Our foundation is service-dominant logic, which provides perspective, vocabulary, and assumptions on which to build a theory. Our basic theoretical construct is the service system, entities that are dynamic configurations of four kinds of resources. Our core principles center on the way value is computed within and among entities, how interaction is based on access to resources and their capabilities, and on how value computation and interaction depend on symbol processing and language guided by mutually agreed-to value propositions. In this context, service science can inform and accelerate value-proposition design by systematizing the search for adaptive advantages that improve existing offerings, create new offerings, or reconfigure the value-creating ecosystem.

Service design builds upon contributions from multiple fields, including management, information technology, and interaction design. Still, more integration to leverage the role of technology for service innovation is needed. This article integrates these two service design perspectives, management and interaction design, into an interdisciplinary method—the Management and INteraction Design for Service (MINDS). Using a design science research approach, MINDS synthesizes management perspective models, which focus on creating new value propositions and orchestrating multiple service interfaces, with interaction design perspective models, which focus on technology usage and its surrounding context. This article presents applications of the MINDS method in two different service industries (media and health care) to demonstrate how MINDS enables creating innovative technology-enabled services and advances interdisciplinary service research.

INSPIRE is a project, that is driven by the European process industry in order to facilitate the relocalization of process industry value chain activities to Europe. Within the project four business model archetypes (BMA) that facilitate this relocalization were identified: decentralization and modularization, mass customization, servitization and product service systems (PSS), circular business model, by name Re-use, Recycle and Sustainability (RR&S). For companies that want to adopt these business models, we have developed four INSPIRE Tools to integrate flexibilization into process industry business models concepts: Technologies Dashboard for the 5 INSPIRE BMA's1, Business Model Innovation (BMI) Game, BMI Decision Support Tool for each BMA, and Business Model Archetype Revenue Pattern Map.

7,2019,"Chen, Y., & Hu, M. (2019). Pricing and matching with forward-looking buyers and sellers. Manufacturing & Service Operations Management.","Problem definition: We study a dynamic market over a finite horizon for a single product or service in which buyers with private valuations and sellers with private supply costs arrive following Poisson processes. A single market-making intermediary decides dynamically on the ask and bid prices that will be posted to buyers and sellers, respectively, and on the matching decisions after buyers and sellers agree to buy and sell. Buyers and sellers can wait strategically for better prices after they arrive. Academic/practical relevance: This problem is motivated by the emerging sharing economy and directly speaks to the core of operations management that is about matching supply with demand. Methodology: The dynamic, stochastic, and game-theoretic nature makes the problem intractable. We employ the mechanism-design methodology to establish a tractable upper bound on the optimal profit, which motivates a simple heuristic policy. Results: Our heuristic policy is: fixed ask and bid prices plus price adjustments as compensation for waiting costs, in conjunction with the greedy matching policy on a first-come-first-served basis. These fixed base prices balance demand and supply in expectation and can be computed efficiently. The waiting-compensated price processes are time-dependent and tend to have opposite trends at the beginning and end of the horizon. Under this heuristic policy, forward-looking buyers and sellers behave myopically. This policy is shown to be asymptotically optimal. Managerial implications: Our results suggest that the intermediary might not lose much optimality by maintaining stable prices unless the underlying market conditions have significantly changed, not to mention that frequent surge pricing may antagonize riders and induce riders and drivers to behave strategically in ways that are hard to account for with traditional pricing models."

Integrating contributions from different fields, CEM was conceptually developed to represent the different aspects of customer experience in a holistic diagrammatic representation. CEM was further developed with an application to a multimedia service. To further develop and build CEM's models, 17 customers of a multimedia service provider were interviewed and the data were analyzed using Grounded Theory methodology. Combining multidisciplinary contributions to represent customer experience elements enables the systematization of its complex information. The application to a multimedia service highlights how CEM can facilitate the work of multidisciplinary design teams by providing more insightful inputs to service design. CEM supports the holistic nature of customer experience, providing a systematic portrayal of its context and shifting the focus from single experience elements to their orchestration.  "

Production and Operations Management, 25(9), 1506-1512.","Operations Management (OM) research on organizational culture has to change to be able to inform practice. Currently, organizational culture research in OM is largely confined to narrow topical and methodological niches and culture is most frequently used as an explanatory variable in quantitative, survey?based research. We argue that the relegation of culture to this niche is due to self?imposed methodological blinders that hobble the OM field. We then present four research imperatives to reinvigorate organizational culture research within our field. We urge OM scholars to view culture as a dynamic concept that can be influenced, to adopt alternative methods, to use non?traditional data sources, and to rethink assumptions about dependent variables. We also identify gaps in the current knowledge and new research questions for the OM domain. We conclude that the field of OM could greatly expand its understanding of organizational culture and in so doing greatly improve business practice, but that to do so will require a change in the culture of the operations management research community."

This transition from physical products to PSSs calls for new ways of working, for example in the product development process. However, so far only limited attention has been put on capabilities needed to succeed with PSS innovation in the very early development phases - often referred to as the fuzzy front end (FFE). This article, therefore, has a dual aim: first, to further our understanding of capabilities for PSS innovation in the FFE, and second, to determine how these capabilities are linked to PSS innovation capabilities needed in subsequent development phases. Empirical data were collected from an ongoing industrial project developing an innovative PSS offering in a large manufacturing company. Individuals connected to the project reported major challenges, both experienced in the FFE and anticipated in later phases, which provided valuable information regarding capabilities needed to succeed with the endeavour.  reveal four links of PSS innovation capabilities: (1) adapting vocabulary and mental models to PSS, (2) handling the 'intangible aspect', (3) bridging organisational structures, and (4) managing new business models. PSS innovation capabilities in the FFE are also found to be of higher order (dynamic) compared to capabilities in later development phases. "

This paper proposes a service-quality-driven service design approach with four phases using the SERVQUAL model and the theory of inventive problem solving (TRIZ). In the ""Retail service quality measurement"" phase, the customer requirements are identified from a service quality perspective. Then, in ""Identifying problem and contradiction elimination"" phase, the above service quality dimensions are figured out by Problem formulator as the parameters to be the input of the service TRIZ contradiction matrix. In ""Specific retail solution generation"" phase, the service TRIZ contradiction matrix is constructed, which leads to the resolution of innovative principles and then new service system can be carried out. Then, we evaluate the new service system in the ""Evaluating customer experience"" phase by using the experiential model. This paper uses a shopping mall case study to verify the proposed novel approach. By using the proposed design approach, a new smart shopping guidance services system: ""Whereabout identified personalized service"" (WIPS) with both interactive signage and Apps was proposed and developed. Finally, a consumer survey was conducted to identify the factors that influenced service quality in the retail business, and to evaluate the consumer perceptions of a shopping image in a tangible shopping district.

In recent years, there has been growing interest from academics, policy-makers and practitioners on service innovation as a new business logic for companies to address societal challenges regarding sustainability. Nevertheless, research specifically focusing on service innovation in relation to sustainability is scarce and ultimately scattered across different research fields. Thereby, only limited clues are available for companies willing to address sustainability challenges through service innovation. To encourage further research in this direction, this paper systematically reviewed the available literature by investigating peer-reviewed publications (from 2004 up to and including 2015) across different fields, which jointly focus on services, innovation and sustainability. The literature review confirmed both the growing amount of research on service innovation in relation to sustainability, as well as the lack of an overarching field to clearly identify such a phenomenon. The review also revealed that three main existing research streams (service innovation, product-service system and sustainability-oriented innovation) contribute to the investigation topic, though all have specific focuses when it comes to the sustainability and innovation dimensions considered. Taking stock of the descriptive and thematic analysis of the review and the identified research gaps, the paper concludes by discussing the need for a clear recognition of the emerging field of sustainability-oriented service innovation, and by outlining several future research pathways for its further enhancement.

However emphasis is being given around CEM, it never feels just enough! Telecom ISP's are looking to generate more awareness of revenue generation and realization, so that it not only is about the increase of top line but also about consolidation of various products and services, almost being an aggregator at one stage to deliver with the help of a single service delivery platform. In other words, what is commonly known as 'VAS-Value added services' in the industry. The key to this is real 'innovation', of newer ideas and productizing these concepts to market. For innovative product management, Telcos are opting to look for 'value added' services, 'value added' delivery as well as enhanced business models and operational frameworks. This is primarily done to carve out an innovation which leads to a differentiator non-existent in the market. A very common, yet unique one such concept can be the 'Balanced Scorecard' perspective and mapping these different perspectives into various domains of a Telecom business. These are obviously very common in present days and widely used by all Telcos to arrive at a definitive decision for any strategic cause. It can be mapped to perspectives ranging from 'financial', 'customer-centricity and 'orientation', internal process management, functionality & delivery, lastly 'internal learning & growth'. We need to understand the context of 'innovation' of 'products & services' under all of these above perspectives. This will give us immense clarity in creating such a differentiated offering to render enhanced Customer experience for better sustainability and thus thriving on market competition. Each layer of a Telco enterprise set up follows specific blueprint, whether it's the business or operations or technology. This will ensure that all company strategies which are focused towards creating and delivering differentiated offerings and delivery are being realized appropriately hence the delta of perception versus reality is minimized to a great extent. This would definitely increase 'customer experience' in all possible forms. Product life cycle management which forms the heart of CEM, should be certainly driven by 'cost of sale' as well as 'price of product'. Both of these parameters should be populated through a Balanced scorecard from a financial perspective to decide on a 'go-no go' decision for concepts to be marketed in a Telco. These need to be realized through specific derivatives of business processes following best practices to ensure enhanced customer experience and better delivery of services to the end customer. Perhaps, the most important perspective of creating a balanced scorecard matrix will be the 'customer centricity' perspective. Two fundamental aspects which drive this would be 'price' and 'quality'. Both of these should be focused on to deliver 'value augmentation'. The difference between what becomes a product or a service 'asset' with regards to what transforms into a 'liability' is this value differentiation through the process described. This leads to customer 'delight' or a differentiated customer 'experience' thus enhanced CEM. "
