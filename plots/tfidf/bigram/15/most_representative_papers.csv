One reason may be that much of what is being said about innovation contributes to misunderstanding. To truly manifest innovation and reap its benefits, one must recognize that innovation is three different things: innovation is an outcome, innovation is a process, and innovation is a mindset. Innovation as an outcome emphasizes what output is sought, including product innovation, process innovation, marketing innovation, business model innovation, supply chain innovation, and organizational innovation. Innovation as a process attends to the way in which innovation should be organized so that outcomes can come to fruition; this includes an overall innovation process and a new product development process. Innovation as a mindset addresses the internalization of innovation by individual members of the organization where innovation is instilled and ingrained along with the creation of a supportive organizational culture that allows innovation to flourish. Such an understanding defines necessary elements, considerations, and vernacular surrounding the term so that better decisions can be made, thereby enabling innovation and having a greater propensity to succeed.

IT tools are supposed to support internal and external information flows, thereby improving a firm's information processing capabilities. However, past research is indecisive about how IT tools influence innovation performance. Furthermore, past research has not considered that services have an increasingly relevant role in a firm's innovation portfolio that can complicate information processing. This study therefore draws on information processing theory and service innovation literature to develop a conceptual model that explains how IT use intensity—depending on the firm's business focus—affects innovation program performance. By using a cross?industry, multi?informant sample of the innovation programs of 116 firms, which were collected from 887 informants, this article provides empirical evidence that (i) intensive IT use in order to exchange information with internal and external stakeholders improves the firm?wide market knowledge, which in turn has a positive impact on a firm's innovation program performance; (ii) the performance impact of market knowledge becomes stronger with increasing degrees of servitization; (iii) a higher degree of servitization reduces IT's use intensity. This research demonstrates the dilemma that servitized firms face: Their business focus hinders the use of IT tools, although the latter will enable them to gain more benefits from the improved market knowledge they create. Practitioner Points: Intensive IT use positively influences the firm?wide innovation performance. The intensive use of IT tools to strengthen internal information flows and IT tools to support exchange with external stakeholders increase a firm's market knowledge, which enhances the innovation program performance. Service innovations have higher information requirements than product innovations and profit therefore more from intensive IT use, but services' complexity hinders IT implementation. Firms with a higher degree of servitization use less IT, although they can profit more from the market knowledge IT tools create. Servitized firms need to install a flexible, modular, and open IT system for efficient IT use and to include all relevant internal and external stakeholders. "

We use the byzantine environment of taxation administration to test and further improve our evaluation model. Our model known as Experience Effectiveness (XE), challenges traditional thinking of service quality as a function of client satisfaction or loyalty. XE uses a multi-participant perspective and is defined in humanist terms of usability, service co-production and the successful completion of the service objective. This paper demonstrates that the strategic use of design in public sector administration can be used to improve citizens' lives. Through evaluating the experiences citizens have interacting with the public sector, governments can prioritise issues, reduce bureaucratic complexity and design better services. Improved public administration will ensure more effective use of revenue and higher levels of compliance with the law through seamless, transparent engagement and higher levels of citizen satisfaction. Initial results from the first of two studies are presented to show the practical application of the XE tool. In the taxation environment, we use the process of starting a small business in Australia as a test case. Both the XE measurement model and the associated citizen-client design are evaluated. The results have significance for all areas that require an objective measure of the impact of design on clients. Experience Effectiveness will also provide objective measures for project governance and performance evaluation. The research demonstrates how successful design outcomes can be a pragmatic alternative to enforcement as the principal approach to deterrence as compliance management. "

The authors develop an analytical model describing perceptual congruence in a dyadic customer-employee relationship using a constant elasticity of substitution (CES) function. This model allows the authors to describe a service context with three factors: 1) customer work-allocation level (that is, percent of work expected to be done by the customer); 2) customer-employee interaction level (that is, level of communication needed); and 3) customer-employee interaction type (that is, superiority or inferiority perceived by the customer and the employee in the interaction). The authors also calculate which type of customer-employee perceptual bias alignment is needed to achieve perceptual congruence under these three contextual factors. Their model may guide service managers how to manage perceptual biases — considering their service design characteristics to achieve perceptual congruence. "

Service Science, 8(3), 344-357.","Strategy research posits that in dynamic environments, firms must base their strategies not on leveraging the past, but on fostering constant change. This research explores how platforms can be used as semistructures to pursue strategic opportunities in manufacturers’ service networks. A platform strategy combining product and organization approaches is identified at the interfirm level. The results show that platforms are perceived to extend the physical product’s capacity to produce new usage scenarios, facilitate interfirm information flows and enable collective benefits, and create awareness of new value potentials. The study calls for more research regarding a systemic approach to solution business."

Smart connected products process comprehensive data in real-time and enable smart services that go far beyond traditional after-sales offerings. Smart services have significantly gained relevance for servitized manufacturers, raised high expectations on their potentials in practice, and are deemed to be key for future competitiveness in increasingly challenging market environments. At the same time, many manufacturers--despite considerable investment in the new technology--fail at taking economic advantage of the potentials, frequently because of vaguely defined competitive strategies and business models. Currently, theory is not able to give appropriate advice. On the one hand, the argumentation for competitive advantage in servitization is stuck in traditional lines of thought that hamper its explanatory power with respect to the phenomena of industrial digitalization. On the other hand, the debate on the role and contribution of digital technologies is still a novel and ill-defined research field and in its infancy when it comes to rigorous strategic reasoning. This thesis sets out to address the existing shortcomings in theory and provide guidance for managers concerned with the formulation of smart-service strategies. The goal is to answer the question of how capital goods manufacturers can increase their competitiveness with smart services, which are described as the result of the concurring trends of servitization and digitalization. Based on a thorough review of literature in the three knowledge bases of servitization, digitalization, and strategic management, the thesis develops a theoretically founded conceptual model of smart-service strategies. In the empirical part of the thesis, the design elements of the conceptual model are validated and operationalized in a cross-sectional interview study before the relationships among the elements of the model are examined in a multiple-case study approach. Based on the juxtaposition of three distinct smart-service approaches in the cross-case study, the thesis refines its conceptual artifacts and develops a management model for smart-service strategies that facilitates the formulation of practical advice for capital goods manufacturers. Based on the empirically validated design model, feasible design guidelines are crafted that support practitioners in defining their firms-- smart-service strategy. From a theoretical point of view, the thesis advances the understanding of the role and contribution of digital technology in servitization and helps to close the gap between the two research strands.

Using an original sample of 1,129 German manufacturing firms, we reverse the hierarchy: product novelty is a main driver of product-related service (PRS) activities. It especially boosts consulting and training services. The structure of the PRS portfolio is dependent on product novelty. Organizational changes toward a more flexible company or the adoption of new advanced manufacturing processes are found, with few exceptions, hardly to influence the decision to offer a product-related service. Our results suggest However, that process innovation is positively linked to the breadth of service surrounding products, whereas organizational innovation is more prone to lead to a larger breadth of services surrounding customer offerings. Product, process, and organizational innovation are not found to be complementary drivers of product-related service offerings. "

An in-depth case study is used to identify design capabilities and document how these have been developed as the firm has adapted its NPD processes to the needs of its service business model. Design capabilities are proposed as a facilitator of servitization, allowing a manufacturing firm to develop service offerings that build on resources such as knowledge and experience. Conversely, the scope of servitization is restricted by the extent to which these design capabilities can be updated to suit the demands of a new business model. Servitization is presented as an imperative for manufacturing firms, yet research has not addressed the implications for NPD nor investigated how BMI affects NPD capabilities. This study shows the need to identify whether current NPD processes help or hinder BMI and proposes how managers can adapt NPD processes to a new business model. A three-stage process is identified for adapting NPD processes – as BMI changes the nature of products and services required, existing processes are supplemented by design activities requiring expert knowledge, these are subsequently refined into design methods that can be incorporated into the NPD process, and eventually design tools allow automation and efficiency.

Integrating contributions from different fields, CEM was conceptually developed to represent the different aspects of customer experience in a holistic diagrammatic representation. CEM was further developed with an application to a multimedia service. To further develop and build CEM's models, 17 customers of a multimedia service provider were interviewed and the data were analyzed using Grounded Theory methodology. Combining multidisciplinary contributions to represent customer experience elements enables the systematization of its complex information. The application to a multimedia service highlights how CEM can facilitate the work of multidisciplinary design teams by providing more insightful inputs to service design. CEM supports the holistic nature of customer experience, providing a systematic portrayal of its context and shifting the focus from single experience elements to their orchestration.  "

This transition from physical products to PSSs calls for new ways of working, for example in the product development process. However, so far only limited attention has been put on capabilities needed to succeed with PSS innovation in the very early development phases - often referred to as the fuzzy front end (FFE). This article, therefore, has a dual aim: first, to further our understanding of capabilities for PSS innovation in the FFE, and second, to determine how these capabilities are linked to PSS innovation capabilities needed in subsequent development phases. Empirical data were collected from an ongoing industrial project developing an innovative PSS offering in a large manufacturing company. Individuals connected to the project reported major challenges, both experienced in the FFE and anticipated in later phases, which provided valuable information regarding capabilities needed to succeed with the endeavour.  reveal four links of PSS innovation capabilities: (1) adapting vocabulary and mental models to PSS, (2) handling the 'intangible aspect', (3) bridging organisational structures, and (4) managing new business models. PSS innovation capabilities in the FFE are also found to be of higher order (dynamic) compared to capabilities in later development phases. "

We examine two case studies of companies which have built mechanisms to facilitate continuous service provision. "

Production and Operations Management, 22(4), 888-914.","Inter?customer interactions are important to the operation of self?services in retail settings. More specifically, when self?service terminals are used as part of customers’ checkout processes in retail operations without the explicit involvement of retailers as the direct service providers, inter?customer interactions become a significant managerial issue. In this article, we examine the impact of inter?customer interactions at retail self?service terminals on customers’ service quality perceptions and repeat purchase intentions at retail stores. We conduct a scenario?based experimental design (N = 674) using a 2 × 2 factorial design in which inter?customer interactions are divided into “positive” vs. “negative” and occur during the “waiting” or during the actual “transaction” stages of self?services at a retail store. We use attribution theory to develop the hypotheses. The results demonstrate that, through their interactions, fellow customers can exert influences on a focal customer's quality perceptions and repeat purchasing intentions toward a retail store. Furthermore, these influences were impacted by how customers attribute blame or assign responsibility toward the retail store. Service operations managers should leverage these interactions by designing into self?service settings the capacities and interfaces that are best suited for customers’ co?production of their self?service experiences."

Manufacturing & Service Operations Management, 19(3), 368-384.","Recent platforms, like Uber and Lyft, offer service to consumers via “self-scheduling” providers who decide for themselves how often to work. These platforms may charge consumers prices and pay providers wages that both adjust based on prevailing demand conditions. For example, Uber uses a “surge pricing” policy, which pays providers a fixed commission of its dynamic price. With a stylized model that yields analytical and numerical results, we study several pricing schemes that could be implemented on a service platform, including surge pricing. We find that the optimal contract substantially increases the platform’s profit relative to contracts that have a fixed price or fixed wage (or both), and although surge pricing is not optimal, it generally achieves nearly the optimal profit. Despite its merits for the platform, surge pricing has been criticized because of concerns for the welfare of providers and consumers. In our model, as labor becomes more expensive, providers and consumers are better off with surge pricing because providers are better utilized and consumers benefit both from lower prices during normal demand and expanded access to service during peak demand. We conclude, in contrast to popular criticism, that all stakeholders can benefit from the use of surge pricing on a platform with self-scheduling capacity."

Using a large sample of consummated and failed listings from the largest online P2P lending marketplace, Prosper.com, we find that the online friendships of borrowers act as signals of credit quality. Friendships increase the probability of successful funding, lower interest rates on funded loans, and are associated with lower ex post default rates. The economic effects of friendships show a striking gradation based on the roles and identities of the friends. We discuss the implications of our findings for the disintermediation of financial markets and the design of decentralized electronic markets."
