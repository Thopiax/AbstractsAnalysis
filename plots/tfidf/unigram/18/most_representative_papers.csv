Management Science, 62(5), 1393-1414.","An extensive literature in economics and finance has documented home bias, the tendency that transactions are more likely to occur between parties in the same geographical area rather than outside. Using data from a large online crowdfunding marketplace and employing a quasi-experimental design, we find evidence that home bias still exists in this virtual marketplace for financial products. Furthermore, through a series of empirical tests, we show that rationality-based explanations cannot fully explain such behavior and that behavioral reasons at least partially drive this remarkable phenomenon. As crowdfunding becomes an alternative and increasingly appealing channel for financing, a better understanding of home bias in this new context provides important managerial, practical, and policy implications."

An empirical, explorative case study of an innovative service system is carried out using a narrative approach and presented in the form of a saga. Insights gleaned from the empirical study are used for conceptual developments. Analysis of the empirical case study is presented as four lessons linked to values, brands, service systems and experience rooms. The paper extends a conceptual framework of innovative resource integration in service ecosystems. The paper also contributes four propositions to inform theory: values resonance is a basis for service innovation, the innovative integration of brands based on values resonance can foster innovation, the integration of resources across service system boundaries grounded in values resonance can enable innovation and the integration of experience rooms into a coherent servicescape based on values resonance can support novel forms of resource integration and value co-creation efforts in service ecosystems.

Retrieved from http://ezproxy.insead.edu:80/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=bth&AN=126256570&site=ehost-live","In the age of the digital organization, and at a time when customers are connected and empowered like never before, there is growing consensus about the importance of a focus on customer experience (CX) in achieving competitive advantage (Hartlen, 2017, Mc Kinsey Quarterly, 2016, Müller et al, 2016, Banfi et al, 2014). This focus on the customer requires that the organization continuously considers ""What do my customers want?"" (Mc Kinsey Quarterly, 2016). Leveraging digital technologies to address and deliver customer needs can have a positive impact on customer satisfaction ratings whilst at the same time, reducing organizational costs (Banfi et al, 2014). However, to be successful, this transformation means rethinking the entire way that organizations work with their customers (Banfi et al, 2014). Organizations require guidance on where and how to improve the customer experience journey in a digital context. Consequently, this research seeks to outline the key facets of a Customer Experience Management (CX) capability in the form of a conceptual model to guide them through this process. The approach adopted in this research was a multi-phase approach. The first phase is grounded in the relevant literature through undertaking a systematic literature review (SLR) and developing a concept matrix on key customer experience themes and how they have evolved with the emergence of digitization. The second phase is concerned with the development of a conceptual model for managing customer experience in the digital context. This customer experience conceptual model may form a key component of the IT Capability Maturity Framework (IT-CMF™) as a critical capability (CC). This research is of particular importance to organizations and practitioners interested in understanding the value of, and guidelines for, developing a CX capability as part of their digital transformation. It is also relevant to academics who are interested in the area of organizational digital transformation. "

We examine two case studies of companies which have built mechanisms to facilitate continuous service provision. "

Multilevel Service Design (MSD) is presented as a new interdisciplinary method for designing complex service systems. MSD synthesizes contributions from new service development, interaction design, and the emerging field of service design. MSD enables integrated development of service offerings at three hierarchical levels: (a) Designing the firm’s service concept with the customer value constellation of service offerings for the value constellation experience; (b) Designing the firm’s service system, comprising its architecture and navigation, for the service experience; and (c) Designing each service encounter with the Service Experience Blueprint for the service encounter experience. Applications of the MSD method are described for designing a new retail grocery service and for redesigning a bank service. MSD contributes an interdisciplinary service design method that accommodates the cocreative nature of customer experiences and enables experience integration from the design of the service concept through the design of the service system and service encounter.

In particular, we investigate how the choice of contract type--among fixed-fee, time-and-materials, and performance-based contracts--is driven by the service environment characteristics. We find that fixed-fee contracts contingent on performance are preferred when the service output is more sensitive to the vendor's effort, that time-and-materials contracts are optimal when the output is more sensitive to the buyer's effort, and that performance-based contracts dominate when the output is equally sensitive to both the buyer's and the vendor's inputs. We also discuss how the performance of these contracts is affected with output uncertainty, process improvement opportunities, and the involvement of multiple buyers and vendors in the joint-production process. Our model highlights the trade-offs underlying the choice of contracts in a collaborative service environment and identifies service process design changes that improve contract efficiency. "

Production and Operations Management, 24(9), 1430-1440.","This study examines the peer?to?Peer interactions among farmers when both knowledge learning and sharing are available. We construct a stylized model in which heterogeneous farmers are endowed with their initial production capabilities and can post questions in the platform for help. A representative expert regularly monitors the forum and provides answers to the farmers’ questions, but may be non?responsive sometimes due to the limited capacity. A knowledgeable core user (farmer) can choose to be silent or responsive, and is allowed to strategically determine the informativeness of her answers. The farmers face the minimum quantity restriction for attracting the buyers, and must make production before the time of sales. We show that in equilibrium the core user never provides answers that are more informative than the expert's, irrespective of her ex ante knowledge level. Redesigning or restructuring the platform does not help eliminate this inefficient knowledge provision. We also find that hiring more staff to frequently monitor the forum turns out to be detrimental for the peer?to?peer interactions. Moreover, the competition on knowledge sharing between the platform expert and the core user features strategic complementarity sometimes but strategic substitution at other times. Third, charging for the platform usage may discourage uninformative answers, but it could also discourage the core user from sharing knowledge with other farmers."

Service Science, 2(4), 225-244.","The literature indicates that there is urgent need to address the significant gap in our ability to value the contributory interaction of service networks in organisational performance. This paper is primarily concerned with exploring how service (re)configuration is utilised to optimise network performance. The paper will summarise the literature review over the past year in the quest to document how we can understand the contributory value of service innovation networks. It identifies some interesting overlaps in business process management, service science, and network innovation literature. This paper will discuss how failing to account for the value of service networks inhibits our capability to discover and monitor service performance and how this complements the evolvement of service science. This prevents managers from transforming information on network activity and infrastructural capabilities into strategic knowledge. This paper demonstrates how social network analysis (SNA) can be a powerful tool for managers to understand organisational network performance and service interaction."

The authors develop an analytical model describing perceptual congruence in a dyadic customer-employee relationship using a constant elasticity of substitution (CES) function. This model allows the authors to describe a service context with three factors: 1) customer work-allocation level (that is, percent of work expected to be done by the customer); 2) customer-employee interaction level (that is, level of communication needed); and 3) customer-employee interaction type (that is, superiority or inferiority perceived by the customer and the employee in the interaction). The authors also calculate which type of customer-employee perceptual bias alignment is needed to achieve perceptual congruence under these three contextual factors. Their model may guide service managers how to manage perceptual biases — considering their service design characteristics to achieve perceptual congruence. "

Manufacturers today tend to place more emphasis on adding value to customers through PSS innovation due to competitions and environment regulations. However, PSS development is a kind of complex innovation facing challenges such as heterogeneity of stakeholders, interaction of product and service elements and complex performance measurement. Thus, manufacturers need systematic innovation management for the success of the PSS. However, the past fragmental studies mainly focus on the design domain rather than the systematic innovation management which provides useful guidance for PSS innovation. In this research, the authors propose an integrative framework for managing PSS innovation. In addition, an application in a PSS innovation project of vending machine is introduced to demonstrate potentials of the framework. "

One reason may be that much of what is being said about innovation contributes to misunderstanding. To truly manifest innovation and reap its benefits, one must recognize that innovation is three different things: innovation is an outcome, innovation is a process, and innovation is a mindset. Innovation as an outcome emphasizes what output is sought, including product innovation, process innovation, marketing innovation, business model innovation, supply chain innovation, and organizational innovation. Innovation as a process attends to the way in which innovation should be organized so that outcomes can come to fruition; this includes an overall innovation process and a new product development process. Innovation as a mindset addresses the internalization of innovation by individual members of the organization where innovation is instilled and ingrained along with the creation of a supportive organizational culture that allows innovation to flourish. Such an understanding defines necessary elements, considerations, and vernacular surrounding the term so that better decisions can be made, thereby enabling innovation and having a greater propensity to succeed.

Types of information systems are heterogeneous because of extreme uncertainty in changes in modern industrial and business systems. To effectively manage information systems, modelling of the work domain (or domain) of information systems is necessary. In this paper, a domain modelling framework for the service system is proposed and its application to the enterprise information system is outlined. The framework is defined based on application of a general domain modelling tool called function-context-behaviour-principle-state-structure (FCBPSS). The FCBPSS is based on a set of core concepts, namely: function, context, behaviour, principle, state and structure and system decomposition. Different from many other applications of FCBPSS in systems engineering, the FCBPSS is applied to both infrastructure and substance systems, which is novel and effective to modelling of service systems including enterprise information systems. It is to be noted that domain modelling of systems (e.g. enterprise information systems) is a key to integration of heterogeneous systems and to coping with unanticipated situations facing to systems.

Organizations delivering experiential services place the customer experience at the core of the service offering. They focus on the experience of customers when interacting with the organization rather than just the functional benefits following from the products and services delivered. Increasingly, organizations are recognizing that managing customer experiences is a powerful way of differentiating from competitors, establishing emotional connections, and increasing customer loyalty. Studying experiential services sheds light on this highly intangible type of services and, by representing an extreme end of the service spectrum, can advance the knowledge on the wider area of new product and service development. This paper addresses three research questions: (1) What are the processes and practices used in the development and design of experiential services? (2) How are these processes and practices similar to or distinct from established NSD practices? (3) How do these  reflect on the wider area of NSD? The study concentrates on five dimensions of NSD: (1) the process; (2) market research; (3) tools and techniques; (4) metrics and performance measurement; and (5) organization. For each of these areas propositions are formulated and refined with empirical data. Using the case research methodology, empirical data were collected in 17 case companies: experiential service providers, design agencies, and consultancies known for focusing on the customer experience. The main method of data collection was interviews with those involved in experiential service design, such as founders, executives, or experienced designers. The case data revealed a number of practices specific to experiential services. These include a strong emphasis on gathering customer insights, in several cases obtained through empathic research and ethnographic research techniques. Other specific practices for experiential services include mapping customer journeys or touchpoints and storytelling. The case study companies also revealed a trade-off between relatively formal, tight methodologies and more flexible, loose methodologies in NSD. More research is required to investigate the contingency factors surrounding tight or loose methodologies. The results also revealed the use of more broadly used NSD practices, such as a systematic NSD process, multiple performance measures, cross-functional teams, and front-line involvement. The observations from this study are captured in a set of seven propositions concerning NSD in experiential services. Reflecting on NSD in general, this study highlights the important role of service process innovation compared with service product innovation and the importance of continuous innovation requiring NSD processes and practices that are more flexible, iterative, and nonlinear. The study also supports the argument that different types of services may require different NSD processes and practices. "

Service design thinking can provide the tools to help redesign value propositions to incorporate solutions that meet customer needs and sustain competitive advantage. However, in order to apply service design thinking effectively in organizational settings characterized by product thinking, some specific issues must be addressed. Based on a case study of a local gas supplier, redgas, we offer three key lessons from applying service design thinking to create new value propositions in the commodity industry: 1) see the bigger picture, 2) select suitable prototyping methods to support a collaborative ideation process, and 3) communicate narratives to and solicit feedback from customers.

Marketing Science, 38(3), 365-391.","The entry of flexible-capacity sharing economy platforms (e.g., Airbnb and Uber) has potentially changed the competitive landscape in traditional industries with fixed-capacity incumbents and volatile demand. Leveraging panel data on hotels and Airbnb, we study how the sharing economy fundamentally changes the way the industry accommodates demand fluctuations and how incumbent firms should strategically respond. The demand estimates suggest that Airbnb’s flexible supply helps recover the lost underlying demand due to hotel seasonal pricing (i.e., higher prices during high-demand seasons) and even stimulates more demand in some cities. The counterfactual results suggest that some hotel types in some cities may benefit from conducting less seasonal pricing and even considering counter-seasonal pricing. Market conditions (e.g., seasonality patterns, hotel prices and quality, consumer composition, and Airbnb supply elasticity) play a crucial role in determining the impact of Airbnb on hotel sales and hotels’ strategic response. Finally, recent Airbnb and policy changes (e.g., higher Airbnb hosting costs due to hotel taxes or lower Airbnb hosting costs due to third-party services and the “professionalism” of hosts) affect the competitive dynamics. The profits of high-end hotels are the most sensitive to the changes in Airbnb hosting costs. Airbnb’s recent attempt to behave more like hotels can increase hotels’ vulnerability to lower Airbnb hosting costs."

Manufacturing & Service Operations Management, 19(3), 368-384.","Recent platforms, like Uber and Lyft, offer service to consumers via “self-scheduling” providers who decide for themselves how often to work. These platforms may charge consumers prices and pay providers wages that both adjust based on prevailing demand conditions. For example, Uber uses a “surge pricing” policy, which pays providers a fixed commission of its dynamic price. With a stylized model that yields analytical and numerical results, we study several pricing schemes that could be implemented on a service platform, including surge pricing. We find that the optimal contract substantially increases the platform’s profit relative to contracts that have a fixed price or fixed wage (or both), and although surge pricing is not optimal, it generally achieves nearly the optimal profit. Despite its merits for the platform, surge pricing has been criticized because of concerns for the welfare of providers and consumers. In our model, as labor becomes more expensive, providers and consumers are better off with surge pricing because providers are better utilized and consumers benefit both from lower prices during normal demand and expanded access to service during peak demand. We conclude, in contrast to popular criticism, that all stakeholders can benefit from the use of surge pricing on a platform with self-scheduling capacity."
