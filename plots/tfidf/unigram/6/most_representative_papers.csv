Management Science, 59(1), 17-35.","We study the online market for peer-to-peer (P2P) lending, in which individuals bid on unsecured microloans sought by other individual borrowers. Using a large sample of consummated and failed listings from the largest online P2P lending marketplace, Prosper.com, we find that the online friendships of borrowers act as signals of credit quality. Friendships increase the probability of successful funding, lower interest rates on funded loans, and are associated with lower ex post default rates. The economic effects of friendships show a striking gradation based on the roles and identities of the friends. We discuss the implications of our findings for the disintermediation of financial markets and the design of decentralized electronic markets."

Manufacturers today tend to place more emphasis on adding value to customers through PSS innovation due to competitions and environment regulations. However, PSS development is a kind of complex innovation facing challenges such as heterogeneity of stakeholders, interaction of product and service elements and complex performance measurement. Thus, manufacturers need systematic innovation management for the success of the PSS. However, the past fragmental studies mainly focus on the design domain rather than the systematic innovation management which provides useful guidance for PSS innovation. In this research, the authors propose an integrative framework for managing PSS innovation. In addition, an application in a PSS innovation project of vending machine is introduced to demonstrate potentials of the framework. "
2,2003,"Xue, M., Harker, P. T., & Heim, G. R. (2003). Incorporating the dual customer roles in e-service design","E-service involves the delivery of useful services through information technology based service delivery channels such as the Internet. A distinguishing feature of e-service is the active and significant participation of customers in the service co-production process. With increasing customer participation in the e-service co-production process, it is important to incorporate customers' needs both as a co-producer and as a patron into the design of e-service systems. However, these dual customer roles create a complex decision problem during e-service design. In the current paper we present a customer orientation strategy for e-service design, and propose a corresponding two-stage decision model based upon the customer orientation strategy to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of e-service design when the focus of the design is to meet customers' needs as both co-producers and patrons. The decision model is then applied in an empirical study of the design of e-services of Internet food retailers. "

One reason may be that much of what is being said about innovation contributes to misunderstanding. To truly manifest innovation and reap its benefits, one must recognize that innovation is three different things: innovation is an outcome, innovation is a process, and innovation is a mindset. Innovation as an outcome emphasizes what output is sought, including product innovation, process innovation, marketing innovation, business model innovation, supply chain innovation, and organizational innovation. Innovation as a process attends to the way in which innovation should be organized so that outcomes can come to fruition; this includes an overall innovation process and a new product development process. Innovation as a mindset addresses the internalization of innovation by individual members of the organization where innovation is instilled and ingrained along with the creation of a supportive organizational culture that allows innovation to flourish. Such an understanding defines necessary elements, considerations, and vernacular surrounding the term so that better decisions can be made, thereby enabling innovation and having a greater propensity to succeed.

Journal of Service Research, 14(2), 180-200. doi:10.1177/1094670511401901 Retrieved from http://ezproxy.insead.edu:80/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=bth&AN=60405623&site=ehost-live","The proliferation of complex service systems raises new challenges for service design and requires new methods. Multilevel Service Design (MSD) is presented as a new interdisciplinary method for designing complex service systems. MSD synthesizes contributions from new service development, interaction design, and the emerging field of service design. MSD enables integrated development of service offerings at three hierarchical levels: (a) Designing the firm’s service concept with the customer value constellation of service offerings for the value constellation experience; (b) Designing the firm’s service system, comprising its architecture and navigation, for the service experience; and (c) Designing each service encounter with the Service Experience Blueprint for the service encounter experience. Applications of the MSD method are described for designing a new retail grocery service and for redesigning a bank service. MSD contributes an interdisciplinary service design method that accommodates the cocreative nature of customer experiences and enables experience integration from the design of the service concept through the design of the service system and service encounter.

This study analyses 13,322 companies in the Japanese manufacturing industry and finds that servitisation contributes to their profitability. The major difference between servitisation companies and others is that the former sell products to end consumers. We examine two case studies of companies which have built mechanisms to facilitate continuous service provision. "
