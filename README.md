# Paper Abstracts Clustering

This project consists in clustering academic papers based on the contents of their abstracts with two different methods: [TF-IDF](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/TF-IDF) vectorization and pre-trained [GloVe](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) vectors with word mover's distance as a similarity metric.
