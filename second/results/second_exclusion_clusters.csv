In most service operations, the customer is not only present but also directly participates in the service delivery process. Such encounters with the service system and the customer's involvement in the service production process have important implications for operations efficiency and effectiveness. Thus, the nature and extent of contact between the customer and the service system should be carefully evaluated in designing service facilities. One approach that has been considered a useful conceptual tool for aiding operations managers in their service design decisions is the customer contact model (CCM). This model classifies service systems into ""high contact,"" ""low contact"" and ""mixed"" services based on the extent of contact between the customer and the service facility. Recently, However, this model's effectiveness as a service management tool has been challenged. CCM has been criticized for failing to sufficiently distinguish between service systems that involve high interaction and customization and those that primarily provide accommodation. The model's capability to assess a service facility's potential efficiency has also been questioned. This paper reevaluates CCM in view of the recent concerns raised about it and offers some extensions which improve the model's performance. It proposes a broadened definition of ""customer contact"" and differentiates between ""active"" and ""passive"" contact. Based on these distinctions, it presents a revised approach for classifying services and for assessing the potential efficiency of service facilities. The extensions provided in this paper would help overcome many of CCM's shortcomings and thus enhance its potential as a viable tool for managing service operations. Therefore, this study, while recognizing the valid criticisms leveled at CCM, asserts that the customer contact concept still provides a useful framework for understanding, designing and controlling service systems.

As competition becomes more intense, product and service providers are increasingly turning towards ""service"" or ""service quality"" as a means of achieving competitive advantages. Even in industries such as telecommunications, where significant technological advances have characterized the industry, companies are realizing that the best product no longer guarantees an advantage over the competition. The key ingredient in the formulation of a competitive service strategy is the proper measurement of service quality dimensions, as defined by the customer, and the continual monitoring of company performance along those dimensions. This article describes the process of identifying service quality dimensions as applied in two telecommunications network providers, one in Canada and one in Ireland. Results are compared and contrasted between the two countries. ",2,2

Management Science, 44(2), 162-172.","Products with high product variety are often made in a manufacturing process (or a supply chain) consisting of multiple stages, with products taking certain features or “personalities” at each stage. The product may start as a common single engine. As the product moves along manufacturing process, more features are added, and the product assumes more identities of the final end product. When demands of the end products are variable from period to period, the production volumes of the intermediate stages in the manufacturing process are also variable. It is widely recognized that variabilities of production volumes may add cost to the process. This paper is motivated by our observations in industry, where some companies have reengineered the manufacturing process by reversing two consecutive stages of the process. Such changes could lead to variance reduction, thereby improving the performance of the process. We develop formalized models that characterize the impact of such changes: operations reversal. These models are used to derive insights on when such reversal would be advisable.",4,5

We model the information services market as a duopoly, where each information service provider is equipped with either packaged or online information delivery technology. They compete for potential subscribers characterized by their usage volume. Subscribers may also choose 'self-service,' wherein they collect and collate information directly from the source. Service design for information service providers must specify their information delivery technology and the size of the database they provide. Service providers first commit to a service design and then enter a price competition phase, where they choose the parameters of their feasible pricing strategies. Specifically, a package service provider chooses a fixed charge for subscription. An online provider chooses both a fixed charge and a marginal charge, because it is possible to meter usage in that technology. We show that the package provider serves high volume subscribers while the online provider serves low volume subscribers. We also derive bounds on equilibrium database sizes, prices, and market shares for each provider. ",3,3

The service's technical features (for example, overnight parcel delivery), its price, and the nature of consumer interactions with the service delivery system influence those utilities. Price and the service's technical features are usually quite objective and readily ascertained by the consumer. However, consumer perceptions about their interactions with the service delivery system are usually far more subjective. Furthermore, service designers can only hope to influence those perceptions indirectly through their decisions about nonlinear processes such as employee recruiting, training, and scheduling policies. Like the service's technical features, these process choices affect quality perceptions, market share, revenues, costs, and profits. We propose a heuristic for the NP-hard service design problem that integrates realistic service delivery cost models with conjoint analysis. The resulting seller's utility function links expected profits to the intensity of a service's influential attributes and also reveals an ideal setting or level for each service attribute. In tests with simulated service design problems, our proposed configurations compare quite favorably with the designs suggested by other normative service design heuristics. ",3,3

However, these dual customer roles create a complex decision problem during e-service design. In the current paper we present a customer orientation strategy for e-service design, and propose a corresponding two-stage decision model based upon the customer orientation strategy to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of e-service design when the focus of the design is to meet customers' needs as both co-producers and patrons.

The Functional Product supplier provides all the support systems that are required to keep the hardware operable. The support systems are often referred to as 'services'. The success of Total Care Products depends upon both hardware and services. Well established methods exist for the design of hardware. In comparison, design processes and methods for services are not so well developed. This paper is concerned with the definition and design of functional Products, in particular design of services in the context of Total Care Products. Literature from the service sector is reviewed extensively to identify the principal components of service design. The information required for the execution of each component of the process, and outputs of each component, are considered with respect to the design of Total Care Products. Of particular interest is the customer-supplier relationship throughout the design process. The design of a Total Care Product may involve the creation of a new service system or there may be an existing system that may be adapted or developed. Similarly, hardware may be mature or be a completely new product. There are therefore number of permutations of novelty and maturity in the hardware and service components of a new Total Care Product. The design processes and methods employed must take into account the required degree of novelty in each component. Typically a customer will be given a guarantee of a certain level of availability of the Total Care Product. This brings into sharp focus the reliability and maintainability of the total system. Further research directions in Total Care Product design are identified especially related to functional reliability.   ",1,1

Attention to the hardware in service organisations, i.e. to the service design, should instead create a more reliable process flow and time for service staff to develop improvement activities and spend more time with customers. The way service organisations began to take excellence seriously was by making their processes transparent, eliminating undesired steps and deleting loops.

MAST is a new concept in transportation that merges the flexibility of demand responsive transit (DRT) systems with the low-cost operability of fixed-route bus systems. A MAST system allows buses to deviate from the fixed path so that customers within the service area may be picked up or dropped off at their desired locations. However, the main purpose of these services should still be to transport customers along a primary direction. The velocity along this direction should remain above a minimum threshold value to maintain the service attractive to customers. We use continuous approximations to compute lower and upper bounds. The resulting narrow gap between them under realistic operating conditions allows us to evaluate the service in terms of velocity and capacity versus demand. The results show that a two-vehicle system, with selected widths of the service area of 0.5 miles and 1 mile, is able to serve, respectively, a demand of at least 10 and 7 customers per longitudinal mile of the service area while maintaining a reasonable forward progression velocity of about 10 miles/hour.

This article summarizes existing work in this area and identifies promising topics for future research. Models of service and relationships can help managers manage service more efficiently, customize service more effectively, manage customer satisfaction and relationships, and model the financial impact of those customer relationships. Models for managing service have often emphasized analytical approaches to pricing, but emerging issues such as the trade-off between privacy and customization are attracting increasing attention. The trade-offs between productivity and customization have also been addressed by both analytical and empirical models, but future research in the area of service customization will likely place increased emphasis on e-service and truly personalized interactions. Relationship models will focus less on models of customer expectations and length of relationship, and more on modeling the effects of dynamic marketing interventions with individual customers. The nature of service relationships increasingly leads to financial impact being assessed within customer and across product, rather than the traditional reverse, suggesting the increasing importance of analyzing customer lifetime value (CLV) and managing the firm’s customer equity.",2,2

In the proposed approach, a blueprint of a service system should be, first, developed to identify the potential fail points and failure modes for both front office and back office service activities. Based on the blueprint, the FMEA tool is then applied to prioritise the critical potential failure modes of the service system and take the required actions to ensure service design performance. An example of a hypermarket service system was used to demonstrate the proposed approach. The example not only identifies the most likely failure modes but also provides the effects and possible causes for each of the most critical failure modes. This implies that the actions to prevent these failures from occurring should be the main focus in the service design stage of the example company. Some managerial implications are also provided.

This is particularly clear in the field of ICT services where business customers are requiring an increasing amount of complex services in order to support their utilization of advanced ERP, SCM and CRM solutions for boosting their business processes and competitive advantage. The complexity of these services and customers’ requests for special adaptations form a critical challenge for service providers. This paper seeks to develop solutions for managing this complexity.  — Three service design and development methods — service industrialization, tangibilization, and service blueprinting — are introduced and then analyzed as to how they can be utilized as an integrated system to reduce the complexity of CT services. This is carried out through an action research-based case study of an CT service provider.  — The results include a service architecture framework, which can be used for creating a modularized offering and implementation system for complex business services. It reduces the complexity of services while allowing their customer specific adaptation.  — Key aspects are the identification of service modules and interfaces in a multi-actor service offering setting and the providing of adequate resources for the design phase of the customized service project. This is essential in order to be able to simultaneously respond to customer specific needs and to reduce the number of existing technologies and overlapping functionalities, seemingly contra dictionary aims. —  of the paper offer significant theoretical and managerial implications for the design and production of complex business services.

Decision Sciences, 32(2), 251-276.","Service designers predict market share and sales for their new designs by estimating consumer utilities. The service's technical features (for example, overnight parcel delivery), its price, and the nature of consumer interactions with the service delivery system influence those utilities. Price and the service's technical features are usually quite objective and readily ascertained by the consumer. However, consumer perceptions about their interactions with the service delivery system are usually far more subjective. Furthermore, service designers can only hope to influence those perceptions indirectly through their decisions about nonlinear processes such as employee recruiting, training, and scheduling policies. Like the service's technical features, these process choices affect quality perceptions, market share, revenues, costs, and profits.
We propose a heuristic for the NP?hard service design problem that integrates realistic service delivery cost models with conjoint analysis. The resulting seller's utility function links expected profits to the intensity of a service's influential attributes and also reveals an ideal setting or level for each service attribute. In tests with simulated service design problems, our proposed configurations compare quite favorably with the designs suggested by other normative service design heuristics.",3,3

Although they are valuable to service managers, they aren't sufficient for success. In this article, Harvard Business School's Frei explains why and urges companies to add some new ones to the mix. After years of extensive research and analysis, she offers an approach for crafting a profitable service business based on four critical elements: the design of the offering, employee management, customer management, and the funding mechanism. Just like a product that's going to market, a service needs to be compellingly designed, and management must field a workforce capable of producing it at an attractive price. Additionally, However, service firms must manage their customers, who do not simply use the service but also can be integral to its production: Because customers' involvement as producers can wreak havoc on costs, companies must also develop creative ways to fund their distinctive offerings, by providing a self-service alternative, for example, or by offsetting expenses with operational savings. A close look at successful service businesses -- Wal-Mart, Commerce Bank, the Cleveland Clinic, and others -- reveals that effective integration of the four elements is key. There is no ""right"" way to combine them; the appropriate design of one depends upon the other three. If managers don't get all four pulling together, they risk pulling the enterprise apart. Incumbents can fend off attacks from highly focused upstarts by becoming multifocused -- that is, by pursuing multiple niches through optimized service models rather than trying to cover the entire waterfront with one model. Shared services within a firm (functions such as HR and finance) can help, since they will enable it to generate economies of scale and experience across models. ",3,3

The authors searched key terms like service integration, product support, post-sales and service-centered. It mentions that most of the literature on this came from the U.S. and papers were mainly found in managerial and business practitioner literature. It highlights that companies face cultural and corporate challenges in implying servitization. It states that one of the main features of strategies related to servitization is customer centricity.

Service Science, 1(2), 121-134.","An interactive method for service design has been proposed for services that heavily depend on human expertise and performance. In this method a simulation model of the service processes is to be constructed based on ethnographic field observation, and then the model is to be validated by showing simulation results to the field experts in a visualized form. In the course of proposing and assessing design options, opinions are repeatedly acquired from the field experts also by showing simulation results. Their expertise can be reflected thereby in the final design through such an interactive design process. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of the proposed design method, the method was applied to ground aircraft operations at a large airport. A simulation model of the service processes at Tokyo International (Haneda) Airport was constructed, and a simulation system was developed on a Java platform for Windows PCs. It was then demonstrated that the simulation could well replicate the observed data of ground aircraft operations. It was also shown that the proposed design method was useful to create new design options for ground aircraft operations and comparatively assess them for improving service performance.",2,2

In this study we employ three competing theoretical frameworks—signaling, efficiency gains, and institutional theory—to analyze the motivations for a firm to acquire quality certification and the performance implications thereafter. We test these hypotheses in the context of CMM certification based on data from the Indian offshore IT services industry between 1997 and 2002. Our results indicate that more cost-effective firms and export-oriented firms are more likely to seek out and acquire certification. In addition, CMM-certified firms show significant improvements in exports, but not on the firm's cost structure. Furthermore, our findings suggest that CMM certification helps indicate firm capabilities to potential customers and thus appear to be most consistent with signaling explanations of certification rather than the efficiency gains or institutional theories.",2,2

We develop an extension of a resource allocation and pricing mechanism for an M/M/1 system. In contrast to the system without the QoS guarantee, where a fixed priority scheduling policy—known as the c? rule—is optimal, we show that the system may need to adopt a more general randomized priority scheduling policy to maximize the overall system profit. We also develop a transfer pricing scheme that is both optimal and incentive compatible, allowing users to act in their self-interests while collectively achieving the system optimum. We show that the pricing scheme with the QoS guarantee depends on the scheduling policy implemented and has different characteristics from that without the QoS guarantee.",4,5

The reduction in labor costs resulting from a more efficient use of human resources is more than enough to cover the required increase in information technology expenditures. This cost?reducing impact is stronger for firms currently employing a lower level of information technologies.

A thorough analysis of this problem in centralized and decentralized setups, both of which occur in practice, is essential for understanding the benefits of collaboration. A key insight offered by this paper is that an efficient implementation of cooperative cache management is possible because, in the centralized scenario, the object allocation resulting in the best social welfare can be found easily as a solution to a transportation problem. For the decentralized scenario involving selfish caches, it is shown that pure equilibria exist and that the cache network always reaches a pure equilibrium in a finite number of steps, starting from any point in the strategy space. An auction mechanism is developed to derive prices that motivate the caches to hold objects in a manner such that the optimal social welfare is attained. In the special case of symmetric caches, simple algorithms are devised to find the optimal social welfare allocation, the best pure equilibrium, and the prices for sharing objects. The results obtained in this paper should be valuable in developing and evaluating cache-management policies. Resource-sharing problems with a similar cost structure exist in a variety of other domains, and the insights gained here are expected to extend to those scenarios as well.",4,5

There could be variations in service system performance across different usage situations and conditions. There could be operator-introduced variations in operating the system, and there could be customer-introduced variability in service operations. Since the specific usage of the service system and the usage conditions can vary, the resultant variations in service performance can impact consumer preferences for and satisfaction with the service system. While some variability has a negative impact on customers, other kinds of variations may be preferred by customers. In designing service systems, one has to understand the sources and types of variability. Any service system that is designed should be robust to these variations––both in system performances and consumer preferences and satisfaction. Achieving the robustness criteria, However, implies consideration of a large number of design criteria across multiple functions––both system design and customer-facing functions.

The of this paper is to propose an approach to enhance perceived service quality by incorporating disservice analysis with failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA).  The approach, first, identifies the potential failure modes that might have explicit effects on the service quality. Subsequently, the risk priority number (RPN) is computed to identify the risk priority for each potential failure mode. Furthermore, a disservice index that represents the extent of composite adverse effect of service failures on quality perceptions is computed to recognize the disservice priority for each quality dimension. Based on which, vital quality dimensions are determined as those quality dimensions that have higher disservice indices. The critical failure modes are, then, confirmed as those failure modes that have higher RPNs in the vital quality dimensions. Finally, the effects and root-causes of the critical failure modes are determined by thoroughly exploiting the service infrastructure, service design, and service encounter for the company to take effective remedial actions to enhance perceived service quality. A practical case regarding a hypermarket service was used to demonstrate the proposed approach. Managerial implications and suggestions are provided to the case company, the hypermarket industry, and other service industries. Possibilities for future research are also addressed.  The vital quality dimensions are determined as responsiveness and reliability for the hypermarket case. Six critical failure modes are confirmed, by the order of criticality, as ""unstable supply of goods/merchandise,"" ""no goods/merchandise on designated shelf of the sales floor,"" ""slowness of cashier speed,"" ""tardiness of warranty/repair goods/merchandise,"" ""nonconforming quality of goods/merchandise,"" and ""unable to find first-line server in the sales floor."" These critical failure modes should be eliminated or reduced in top priority to enhance perceived service quality. Note that the determination of vital quality dimensions and the confirmation of critical failure modes depend on the applicable company resources. - The proposed approach improves both the academic and the practical developments of service quality in five aspects: explicitly identifying potential mistakes or failures of the service system that might result in disservice of quality.

In particular, we investigate how the choice of contract type--among fixed-fee, time-and-materials, and performance-based contracts--is driven by the service environment characteristics. We find that fixed-fee contracts contingent on performance are preferred when the service output is more sensitive to the vendor's effort, that time-and-materials contracts are optimal when the output is more sensitive to the buyer's effort, and that performance-based contracts dominate when the output is equally sensitive to both the buyer's and the vendor's inputs. We also discuss how the performance of these contracts is affected with output uncertainty, process improvement opportunities, and the involvement of multiple buyers and vendors in the joint-production process. Our model highlights the trade-offs underlying the choice of contracts in a collaborative service environment and identifies service process design changes that improve contract efficiency. ",4,5

Multilevel Service Design (MSD) is presented as a new interdisciplinary method for designing complex service systems. MSD synthesizes contributions from new service development, interaction design, and the emerging field of service design. MSD enables integrated development of service offerings at three hierarchical levels: (a) Designing the firm’s service concept with the customer value constellation of service offerings for the value constellation experience; (b) Designing the firm’s service system, comprising its architecture and navigation, for the service experience; and (c) Designing each service encounter with the Service Experience Blueprint for the service encounter experience. Applications of the MSD method are described for designing a new retail grocery service and for redesigning a bank service. MSD contributes an interdisciplinary service design method that accommodates the cocreative nature of customer experiences and enables experience integration from the design of the service concept through the design of the service system and service encounter.

Organizations delivering experiential services place the customer experience at the core of the service offering. They focus on the experience of customers when interacting with the organization rather than just the functional benefits following from the products and services delivered. Increasingly, organizations are recognizing that managing customer experiences is a powerful way of differentiating from competitors, establishing emotional connections, and increasing customer loyalty. Studying experiential services sheds light on this highly intangible type of services and, by representing an extreme end of the service spectrum, can advance the knowledge on the wider area of new product and service development. This paper addresses three research questions: (1) What are the processes and practices used in the development and design of experiential services? (2) How are these processes and practices similar to or distinct from established NSD practices? (3) How do these  reflect on the wider area of NSD? The study concentrates on five dimensions of NSD: (1) the process; (2) market research; (3) tools and techniques; (4) metrics and performance measurement; and (5) organization. For each of these areas propositions are formulated and refined with empirical data. Using the case research methodology, empirical data were collected in 17 case companies: experiential service providers, design agencies, and consultancies known for focusing on the customer experience. The main method of data collection was interviews with those involved in experiential service design, such as founders, executives, or experienced designers. The case data revealed a number of practices specific to experiential services. These include a strong emphasis on gathering customer insights, in several cases obtained through empathic research and ethnographic research techniques. Other specific practices for experiential services include mapping customer journeys or touchpoints and storytelling. The case study companies also revealed a trade-off between relatively formal, tight methodologies and more flexible, loose methodologies in NSD. More research is required to investigate the contingency factors surrounding tight or loose methodologies. The results also revealed the use of more broadly used NSD practices, such as a systematic NSD process, multiple performance measures, cross-functional teams, and front-line involvement. The observations from this study are captured in a set of seven propositions concerning NSD in experiential services. Reflecting on NSD in general, this study highlights the important role of service process innovation compared with service product innovation and the importance of continuous innovation requiring NSD processes and practices that are more flexible, iterative, and nonlinear. The study also supports the argument that different types of services may require different NSD processes and practices. ",2,2

In five experiments that simulate service experiences in the domains of online travel and online dating, we demonstrate the impact of the labor illusion on service value perceptions, demonstrate that perceptions of service provider effort induce feelings of reciprocity that together mediate the link between operational transparency and increased valuation, and explore boundary conditions and alternative explanations.",2,2

Few studies have focused on the stages, activities, and techniques of NSD. In addition, the NSD process is delivered through service value net, and can often be carried out by multiple companies. Therefore, this study aims to provide a SAT (Stage-Activity-Technique) framework for NSD stages, activities, and techniques based on a literature review and trend analysis. This study divides the NSD process into five stages: service identification, service value net formation, service modeling, service implementation, and service commercialization. In addition, the NSD process is more likely to be spiral in form for new services that are examined. The NSD process is also likely to be refined by service providers and customers to incorporate their detailed requirements and integrate service value into future development processes. The SAT model can assist service designers and engineers in developing new services by providing a structured NSD process and identifying techniques for activities in the NSD process.",3,3

Moreover, instead of passively mimicking their peers (irrational herding), lenders engage in active observational learning (rational herding); they infer the creditworthiness of borrowers by observing peer lending decisions and use publicly observable borrower characteristics to moderate their inferences. Counterintuitively, obvious defects (e.g., poor credit grades) amplify a listing's herding momentum, as lenders infer superior creditworthiness to justify the herd. Similarly, favorable borrower characteristics (e.g., friend endorsements) weaken the herding effect, as lenders attribute herding to these observable merits.

This approach recognises the diverse views and transformation goals of multiple stakeholders, fosters value co-creation in achieving desirable outcomes and uncovers synergies between system entities and various PSS elements.

Service Science, 5(3), 263-275.","Innovation is of continuing interest to professional service firms (PSFs) and the scholars who study them. Nevertheless, innovation in PSFs remains underresearched within the wider canon of literature on service innovation, and existing studies typically take a firm-centric perspective on innovation, even though such approaches have been challenged extensively. Our study addresses the shortcomings related to service innovation research, particularly in the context of PSFs, by utilizing the service-dominant logic (SDL)—a framework considered particularly appropriate for understanding innovation in service from a customer-centric standpoint. We apply the SDL to a case of innovation in an engineering consulting firm, and we find that innovation in PSFs is, to a certain degree, unique. Specifically, this work contributes to the literature by identifying multiple beneficiary roles, termed “customer as payer” and “customer as end user,” with often competing and changing values in use. The notion of operant resources is extended to include social capital, and we show how social capital can enable innovation in PSFs. A preliminary model and five propositions that can guide future empirical research on innovation in PSFs, together with managerial implications, are delineated.",2,2

Contrary to the economic benefits expected, recent findings pinpoint implementation hurdles that lead to a potential performance decline, the so?called ‘servitization paradox’. In this paper, we analyze this paradox by disentangling the value creation and value appropriation processes of 44 national subsidiaries of a global manufacturing firm turned product?service provider, in the 2001–2007 period. Our findings show that the firm under study is able to successfully transcend the inherent substitution of products by services and to enact complementary sales dynamics between the two activities. Moreover, labor?intensive services such as maintenance, which imply higher levels of customer proximity, further enhance product sales. Empirical results also reveal a positive yet non?linear relationship between the scale of service activities and profitability: while initial levels of servicing result in a steep increase in profitability, a period of relative decline is observed before the positive relationship between the scale of services and profitability re?emerges. These findings suggest the presence of initial short?term gains but also indicate the existence of a ‘profitability’ hurdle; profitable growth seems feasible only to the extent that investments in service capability are translated into economies of scale. In helping to clarify the performance implications of service innovation, our findings suggest pathways to sustainable growth through servitization for manufacturing firms.",2,2

At the same time, firms need to retain exclusive control over some essential components to capture value from their product and/or service system. This paper contributes to the literature by analyzing some of the trade-offs between openness to external value creation and closedness for internal value capture. It focuses on selective openness as a key variable and investigates how it affects value creation by external complementors, specifically the members of user innovation communities. Openness, it is hypothesized, matters to community members: The more open a product design is, the higher their sense of involvement in the innovation project, and the larger the effort they devote to it. Unlike prior literature, different forms and loci of openness are distinguished, specifically the transparency, accessibility, and replicability of different components of the product being developed. Hypotheses are tested based on survey data ( n = 309) from 20 online communities in the consumer electronics and information technology hardware industries. Multilevel regression analysis is used to account for clustering, and thus nonindependent data, at the community level. We find that openness indeed increases community members' involvement in the innovation project and their contributions to it. Interestingly, However, some forms and loci of openness strongly affect community perceptions and behavior, while others have limited or no impact. This finding suggests that, at least in relation to user communities, the trade-off that firms face between external value creation and internal value capture is softer than hitherto understood. Contingency factors that may be able to explain these patterns are advanced. For example, users are expected to value the form of openness that they have the capabilities and incentives to exploit. The  in this paper extend the literature on selective openness in innovation. They emphasize the need to study the demand for different forms of openness at the subsystem level and align supply-side strategies to it. In managerial practice, a careful assessment of the demand for openness enables firms to successfully use selective openness and to effectively appropriate value from selectively open systems. ",2,2

In this paper, we develop an analytical model of joint production between a service provider and a customer and characterize how a service firm should design its coproductive system. We show that, as a task becomes more standard, it is desirable to decrease the degree of interaction between the provider and the customer by making their efforts more substitutable and to allocate most of the work to whoever is the most efficient. Conversely, as a task becomes less standard, it is optimal to increase interaction by making efforts more complementary and to balance the work allocation.

A set of hypotheses was developed and tested using data from R&D activities related to service innovation projects. The findings suggest that the technology developed through R&D contributes to value cocreation interactions between the R&D organization and the customer, which are facilitated by mutual organizational understanding. They also contribute to the discovery of research themes. The result is the emergence of a new type of service-oriented researcher who focuses not only on creating new technologies and adapting them to the customer site but also on discovering research themes by broadening the scope of research to the creation of new service systems. The managerial implications and limitations of these findings are discussed.",2,2

It implies that provider companies should change their focus from goods to service and to interaction with customers. Moreover, it means that the customers' role becomes increasingly important in a business activity. This kind of renewal is a learning challenge, as it includes a profound change in the providers' orientation and concrete practices to enhance customer understanding and foster collaboration. This article aims to deepen our knowledge about the complex social reality in which interaction, collaboration, and change processes take place by connecting the service-dominant logic and learning literature. Concrete ways of collaboration and activity changes are examined empirically in a case study. This case study illustrates how and what an information technology company learned when it, together with its customer and end users, developed its offering for service orientation. The results indicate that a genuine change in orientation requires both collaborative experimenting and conceptual learning; i.e., practical experience and its broader reflection go hand in hand. From a theoretical viewpoint, the study provides new insights into the interfaces of service-dominant logic and learning theories in the examination of collaborative service development and service innovation.",2,2

We construct a stylized model in which heterogeneous farmers are endowed with their initial production capabilities and can post questions in the platform for help. A representative expert regularly monitors the forum and provides answers to the farmers’ questions, but may be non?responsive sometimes due to the limited capacity. A knowledgeable core user (farmer) can choose to be silent or responsive, and is allowed to strategically determine the informativeness of her answers. The farmers face the minimum quantity restriction for attracting the buyers, and must make production before the time of sales. We show that in equilibrium the core user never provides answers that are more informative than the expert's, irrespective of her ex ante knowledge level. Redesigning or restructuring the platform does not help eliminate this inefficient knowledge provision. We also find that hiring more staff to frequently monitor the forum turns out to be detrimental for the peer?to?peer interactions. Moreover, the competition on knowledge sharing between the platform expert and the core user features strategic complementarity sometimes but strategic substitution at other times. Third, charging for the platform usage may discourage uninformative answers, but it could also discourage the core user from sharing knowledge with other farmers.",2,2

However emphasis is being given around CEM, it never feels just enough! Telecom ISP's are looking to generate more awareness of revenue generation and realization, so that it not only is about the increase of top line but also about consolidation of various products and services, almost being an aggregator at one stage to deliver with the help of a single service delivery platform. In other words, what is commonly known as 'VAS-Value added services' in the industry. The key to this is real 'innovation', of newer ideas and productizing these concepts to market. For innovative product management, Telcos are opting to look for 'value added' services, 'value added' delivery as well as enhanced business models and operational frameworks. This is primarily done to carve out an innovation which leads to a differentiator non-existent in the market. A very common, yet unique one such concept can be the 'Balanced Scorecard' perspective and mapping these different perspectives into various domains of a Telecom business. These are obviously very common in present days and widely used by all Telcos to arrive at a definitive decision for any strategic cause. It can be mapped to perspectives ranging from 'financial', 'customer-centricity and 'orientation', internal process management, functionality & delivery, lastly 'internal learning & growth'. We need to understand the context of 'innovation' of 'products & services' under all of these above perspectives. This will give us immense clarity in creating such a differentiated offering to render enhanced Customer experience for better sustainability and thus thriving on market competition. Each layer of a Telco enterprise set up follows specific blueprint, whether it's the business or operations or technology. This will ensure that all company strategies which are focused towards creating and delivering differentiated offerings and delivery are being realized appropriately hence the delta of perception versus reality is minimized to a great extent. This would definitely increase 'customer experience' in all possible forms. Product life cycle management which forms the heart of CEM, should be certainly driven by 'cost of sale' as well as 'price of product'. Both of these parameters should be populated through a Balanced scorecard from a financial perspective to decide on a 'go-no go' decision for concepts to be marketed in a Telco. These need to be realized through specific derivatives of business processes following best practices to ensure enhanced customer experience and better delivery of services to the end customer. Perhaps, the most important perspective of creating a balanced scorecard matrix will be the 'customer centricity' perspective. Two fundamental aspects which drive this would be 'price' and 'quality'. Both of these should be focused on to deliver 'value augmentation'. The difference between what becomes a product or a service 'asset' with regards to what transforms into a 'liability' is this value differentiation through the process described. This leads to customer 'delight' or a differentiated customer 'experience' thus enhanced CEM. ",3,3

Using data from 676 human resource management services, this study finds that the service value is highest when the service provision is matched with the commonality potential of the services. The results indicate that using the wrong delivery channel decreases the service value which eventually could decrease the service value for an organization's external customers.

To understand this changing landscape, the authors engaged in an international and interdisciplinary research effort to identify research priorities that have the potential to advance the service field and benefit customers, organizations, and society. The priority-setting process was informed by roundtable discussions with researchers affiliated with service research centers and networks located around the world and resulted in the following 12 service research priorities: stimulating service innovation, facilitating servitization, service infusion, and solutions, understanding organization and employee issues relevant to successful service, developing service networks and systems, leveraging service design, using big data to advance service, understanding value creation, enhancing the service experience, improving well-being through transformative service, measuring and optimizing service performance and impact, understanding service in a global context, and leveraging technology to advance service. For each priority, the authors identified important specific service topics and related research questions. Then, through an online survey, service researchers assessed the subtopics’ perceived importance and the service field’s extant knowledge about them. Although all the priorities and related topics were deemed important, the results show that topics related to transformative service and measuring and optimizing service performance are particularly important for advancing the service field along with big data, which had the largest gap between importance and current knowledge of the field. The authors present key challenges that should be addressed to move the field forward and conclude with a discussion of the need for additional interdisciplinary research. ",2,2

With the globalization of business, service organizations have access to many of the same external resources. As a result, services must look internally to how they design their delivery processes to increase the value of their offerings. One element that appears to offer such opportunities is the creation of service inventories in the design of the service delivery process. We define service inventory as any tangible or intangible operand resource that is transformed by the service provider with or without customer input and is stored prior to the customer’s arrival. The goal of service inventories is to facilitate the steps in the service delivery process, thereby creating customer value during the service encounter. Within this context, service inventories can be either physical or digital; we focus primarily on the creation of digital service inventories and how they add value for both the provider and the customer.",3,3

In contrast, the recipient’s benefits from knowledge transfer may be lagged because of the difficulties in articulating and documenting knowledge as well as the challenges regarding its interpretation and application. Over time, as each team embeds knowledge in the NPD project, the levels of product and process performance increase, thereby increasing the net revenue earned at the product launch time. In a key contribution to the literature, analytic conditions are given that characterize the dynamic rates at which knowledge development and knowledge transfer occur throughout the project.

Our main objective is to explore using simple and stylized models, the effect on the service system of local innovations in step 1 that decrease this step's service times. We find that the effect of such innovations can sometimes lead to the worsening of certain critical service quality measures when SPs are monopolists.

For this purpose, the author conducted a systematic review, which paved the way for the identification of the concept of “health care co-production” and allowed to discuss its effects and implications. Starting from a database of 254 records, 65 papers have been included in systematic review and informed the development of this paper. Co-production of health care services implies the establishment of co-creating partnerships between health care professionals and patients, which are aimed at mobilizing the dormant resources of the latter. However, several barriers prevent the full implementation of health care co-production, nurturing the application of the traditional bio-medical model. Co-production of health care is difficult to realize, due to both health care professionals’ hostility and patients unwillingness to be involved in the provision of care. Nonetheless, the scientific literature is consistent in claiming that co-production of care paves the way for increased health outcomes, enhanced patient satisfaction, better service innovation, and cost savings. The establishment of multi-disciplinary health care teams, the improvement of patient-provider communication, and the enhancement of the use of ICTs for the of value co-creation are crucial ingredients in the recipe for increased patient engagement.

Institutions and stakeholders within the service ecosystem, However, often resist change. Adopting a new service strategy entails two distinct costs – monetary and psychological. The tensions between an organization’s need to generate incremental revenue and the challenges of balancing business as usual and the costs associated with service innovation are explored. Specifically, this paper aims to explore the adoption of a customer relationship management (CRM) technology solution in a bureaucratic setting, and the sequence of events needed for successful implementation, with emphasis on overcoming various barriers and hurdles. A case study methodology is used to gather and analyze data on how the Arizona State University (ASU) athletic department responded to the changing competitive environment via adopting a CRM technology solution. Data collection consisted of ten semi-structured interviews. The experience of ASU illustrates that the primary benefits of a CRM technology solution include the generation of incremental revenue, capturing data and personalized marketing. The main challenges are coordinating adoption, obtaining commitment, developing competency, estimating costs and creating content. A conceptual framework emerged from the data that describes the likelihood of a service technology’s successful implementation based upon the interaction of the strength of key actors, organizational situation perception and organizational commitment. The model extends the proposed duality of service innovation outcomes as either success or failure to acknowledge the likelihood of a partial implementation where marginal success is achieved. The sequence of events needed for successful implementation of a service technology is highlighted, with emphasis on overcoming various barriers and hurdles. Implementation steps are provided, as well as a model to help pinpoint issues. The case study provides insight for overcoming pitfalls and barriers to adopting a new service technology in a traditionally bureaucratic organization where resistance to change is the norm, and innovation is not.

Moreover, customer responses to service design choices can be assessed based on the results of a video experiment. Consequently, we position video experiments as a particularly well-suited method for examining innovations that are related to the application of behavioral science insights or what we term as behavioral-based service innovations.

Service Science, 8(3), 249-262.","The recent emergence of social media-based brand communities is seen as an effective channel for practicing user-centric service innovation. However, user participation is the major hurdle in their sustainability. Despite the growing popularity of these brand communities, there has been only limited research examining the factors affecting user intention to continue using these communities. Teenagers represent an important demographic group, not only as the dominant users, but also in their value and potential in contributing toward successful business. To date, no previous research has investigated the participation behaviour of teenagers in these communities. To address this research gap, the present study examines the factors affecting teenagers’ intention to continue participating in Facebook-based brand communities. The roles of social and individual factors in the formulation of their attitudes to participation are examined. The relationship between users’ attitudes, activity levels, and continuation intentions are explored. The study findings suggest that self-efficacy, hedonic motivation, reciprocal benefit, and social influence have a positive impact on user attitude. Among these, self-efficacy has the strongest influence. Furthermore, attitude, continuation intention, and activity levels are significantly related. The findings have implications for organisations intending to use social media-based brand communities to practice user-centric service innovation.",3,3

Yet there are few guidelines available for designing service encounters with a focus on customer satisfaction. In this paper, we show how experiential services should be sequenced and timed to maximize the satisfaction of customers who are subject to memory decay and acclimation. We find that memory decay favors positioning the highest service level near the end, whereas acclimation favors maximizing the gradient of service level. Together, they maximize the gradient of service level near the end. Although memory decay and acclimation lead to the same design individually, they can act as opposing forces when considered jointly. Overall, our analysis suggests that short experiences should have activities scheduled as a crescendo and duration allocated primarily to the activities with the highest service levels, whereas long experiences should have activities scheduled in a U-shaped fashion and duration allocated primarily to activities with the lowest service level so as to ensure a steep gradient at the end.",2,2

We identify these free gifts as a meaningful service design choice that helps service providers innovate service. Specifically, we examine the circumstances under which experiential or material gifts are preferred and generate greater consumer satisfaction, enhancing the overall service experience. Across three experiments, we demonstrate that consumers are generally happier with experiential offerings, and they prefer (and are more satisfied with) experiential offerings on ordinary consumption occasions; experiential elements are believed to further enrich otherwise mundane experiences. However, this experiential advantage disappears for consumers on meaningful and special occasions because of a strong desire to obtain a memory cue that will help them recall the experience. Indeed, the preference for a material item holds only when the gift has the quality to serve as a salient memory marker. This research provides insight for managers to take into account consumption occasions or types of consumers (e.g., special occasions, repeat customers) to effectively design service bundles with complimentary gifts and thus better manage overall service experience.",2,2

(2) To what extent do diffusion processes of sustainable product and service innovations differ from each other, and can different groups of diffusion processes be identified? (3) Which factors, actors, and institutional settings are characteristic of different groups of diffusion processes?
 While diffusion research on sustainable innovation so far has been limited to case studies with just one or a small number of cases or has been focused on individual sectors, the empirical data presented here cover a large number of cases from a broad variety of product fields. This allows for generalizations as well as relevant insights and conclusions for sustainability, environmental and innovation policies.
 The empirical investigation of 100 sustainable product and service innovations revealed that diffusion processes of sustainable innovations differ substantially: The cluster analysis showed that five groups of sustainable innovations can be differentiated which differ significantly in terms of the factors influencing the diffusion process. The empirical results thus both support the assumption that different types of diffusion paths do in fact exist and also permit characterization of the various types of diffusion paths. The evolutionary concept of diffusion paths develops significant explanatory power on the basis of which faster or slower cases of diffusion and the success or failure of sustainable innovations can be better understood.

We show the treatment reduces by half the number of customers who churn from the service during the first week. Further, treated customers ask 19.55% fewer questions during the first week of their tenure than the controls. Although the treatment’s effects decay within one week, we show that such proactive customer education can have significant economic benefits for the provider. In particular, we find that treated customers increase their accumulated usage of the service by 46.57% in the eight months after sign-up. Finally, we provide evidence that the effects of the treatment are strongest among customers who have less experience with the provider.",3,3

Data used in diverse information services can spur new business insights, benefit corporate-wide decision making, enable automation, contribute to new products and services, and ensure customer satisfaction. Unlocking this value requires effective management of information services. However, today's information management in commercial and industrial enterprises is unable to cope with the growing requirements of internal and external customers, business partners, and regulators. Information management rarely possesses a clear vision of its future role for business success. It also lacks concrete methodologies for identifying and implementing the necessary organizational and technical changes in the face of various new data sources and technologies. This dissertation proposes information service orientation as guiding vision for future information management. This vision considers information services as information management's main value-adding output. Following a Design Science Research paradigm, this dissertation develops two artifacts to support this information service management in the digital economy. The first artifact is a capability reference model, a target framework for information service management. It describes the capabilities that future information service management should possess so as to develop and provide successful information services to its stakeholders. The second artifact is a reference method for capability-based information service design. It supports new information service development and identifies their prerequisite capabilities. Results are based on consortium research, which used literature research, seven case studies, two action design research projects, and eight focus groups as main research methods. Results address academics and practitioners interested in information services and information service management in the digital economy.

Smart connected products process comprehensive data in real-time and enable smart services that go far beyond traditional after-sales offerings. Smart services have significantly gained relevance for servitized manufacturers, raised high expectations on their potentials in practice, and are deemed to be key for future competitiveness in increasingly challenging market environments. At the same time, many manufacturers--despite considerable investment in the new technology--fail at taking economic advantage of the potentials, frequently because of vaguely defined competitive strategies and business models. Currently, theory is not able to give appropriate advice. On the one hand, the argumentation for competitive advantage in servitization is stuck in traditional lines of thought that hamper its explanatory power with respect to the phenomena of industrial digitalization. On the other hand, the debate on the role and contribution of digital technologies is still a novel and ill-defined research field and in its infancy when it comes to rigorous strategic reasoning. This thesis sets out to address the existing shortcomings in theory and provide guidance for managers concerned with the formulation of smart-service strategies. The goal is to answer the question of how capital goods manufacturers can increase their competitiveness with smart services, which are described as the result of the concurring trends of servitization and digitalization. Based on a thorough review of literature in the three knowledge bases of servitization, digitalization, and strategic management, the thesis develops a theoretically founded conceptual model of smart-service strategies. In the empirical part of the thesis, the design elements of the conceptual model are validated and operationalized in a cross-sectional interview study before the relationships among the elements of the model are examined in a multiple-case study approach. Based on the juxtaposition of three distinct smart-service approaches in the cross-case study, the thesis refines its conceptual artifacts and develops a management model for smart-service strategies that facilitates the formulation of practical advice for capital goods manufacturers. Based on the empirically validated design model, feasible design guidelines are crafted that support practitioners in defining their firms-- smart-service strategy. From a theoretical point of view, the thesis advances the understanding of the role and contribution of digital technology in servitization and helps to close the gap between the two research strands.

This results in four strategies: the McService strategy that is standardized and transactional, the Relational Service strategy that is standardized and relational, the Customized Transaction strategy that is personalized and transactional, and the Adaptive Personalization strategy that is personalized and relational. We provide firms a roadmap for identifying a 'sweet spot' strategy in relation to a segment's realized or potential customer lifetime value, combined with the firm's technological capabilities. Because technological capabilities inevitably advance, firms will tend to move from standardized to personalized and from transactional to relational over time, implying that firms should be alert to technological opportunities to personalize their relationships with customers.

Through evaluating the experiences citizens have interacting with the public sector, governments can prioritise issues, reduce bureaucratic complexity and design better services. Improved public administration will ensure more effective use of revenue and higher levels of compliance with the law through seamless, transparent engagement and higher levels of citizen satisfaction. Initial results from the first of two studies are presented to show the practical application of the XE tool. In the taxation environment, we use the process of starting a small business in Australia as a test case. Both the XE measurement model and the associated citizen-client design are evaluated. The results have significance for all areas that require an objective measure of the impact of design on clients. Experience Effectiveness will also provide objective measures for project governance and performance evaluation. The research demonstrates how successful design outcomes can be a pragmatic alternative to enforcement as the principal approach to deterrence as compliance management. ",2,2

Variants of such business models have been suggested for decades, and there are notable success stories such as the Xerox product-service offering based on photocopiers that are remanufactured. Still, we are not seeing widespread adoption in industry. This paper examines causes for reluctance. Drawing on a hypothesis-testing framework of business model innovation, we show that circular business models imply significant challenges to proactive uncertainty reduction for the entrepreneur. Moreover, we show that many product-service system variants that facilitate return flow control in circular business models further aggravate the potential negative effects of failed uncertainty reduction because of increased capital commitments. Through a longitudinal action research study we also provide a counterexample to many of the challenges identified in previous studies, which could be overcome in the studied case. ",2,2

The vast majority of studies on the service journey, also known as servitization or service transition, examine the challenges and enablers of the process of change through cases studies. Investigations that provide an in-depth longitudinal analysis of the steps involved in the service journey are much rarer. Such a detailed understanding is required in order to appreciate fully how firms can leverage the enablers while overcoming the challenges of servitization. This study investigates what does a service journey look like? It analyzes in some detail the actual service journeys undertaken by three firms in the well-being, engineering and learning sectors. The paper offers four contributions. First, in the change literature, there are two dominant theories: The punctuated equilibrium model and the continuous change model. This study demonstrates that servitization follows a continuous change rather than a punctuated equilibrium. It shows that such continuous change is neither logical nor structured but much more emergent and intuitive in nature. Second, the study provides empirical evidence to support a contingency view of the dominance and sequencing of the different process models of change across the change journey. Third, this research shows the pace of service development and when the coexistence of basic, intermediate and complex services occurs. Finally, it contributes to the literature in the service field by presenting three actual service journeys and the associated seven stages of the service strategy model that organizations should consider when managing their service journeys.

Two samples (Study 1: n=474, Study 2: n=225) of consumers are used to empirically test the proposed model.

Yet, it remains unclear how this change in the market strategy and the underpinning innovation in the business model - the activity system design -jointly create value. Relying on 12 case studies of product providers that shifted to providing highly sophisticated service offerings - outcome-based contracts - we derive theoretical propositions regarding the interplay of service market strategy and business model innovation on value creation. The product providers we studied report two interdependent changes that they pursue to secure the required fit; they evolve the market strategy from pure products to outcomes so as to achieve a better fit with the client's needs and to grow the service business. In parallel, they 'open up' their business models to maintain the internal activity system's fit with their core competencies while relying on ecosystem partners for activities outside the provider's competence base. This allows them to grow their service businesses effectively and efficiently. At the same time, However, the shift to an outcome market strategy demands enhanced accountability to customers and increases the threat of penalty in the case of failure, while opening up the business model produces loss of control over the activity system and increases the threat of failure from partner dependency. Thus, we find that the service provider's success hinges on the ability to balance the trade-off between increased value creation and increased uncertainty associated with service strategy/open business model interplay.

The introduction of this transparency contributed to a 22.2% increase in customer-reported quality and reduced throughput times by 19.2%. Laboratory studies revealed that customers who observed process transparency perceived greater employee effort and thus were more appreciative of the employees and valued the service more. Employees who observed customer transparency felt that their work was more appreciated and more impactful and thus were more satisfied with their work and more willing to exert effort. We find that transparency, by visually revealing operating processes to consumers and beneficiaries to producers, generates a positive feedback loop through which value is created for both parties.",3,3

For both vertical and horizontal settings with deterministic market sizes, we characterize the optimal pricing and production decisions of a monopoly firm with two technologies. We establish the necessary and sufficient conditions for dual activation (i.e., using both technologies) to be optimal. Dual activation is driven by differences in marginal costs across the two technologies. There is an additional motive for dual activation in the horizontal setting: the desire to generate a product mix that better resembles the market mix. Building on the optimal production analysis, we characterize the optimal adoption-and-usage strategy of a firm with one incumbent technology considering a new technology. We establish the conditions for which a new technology will displace the incumbent or be used with the incumbent, and highlight some important adoption and usage differences between vertical and horizontal settings.

Using a game?theoretic model, our study reveals how organizations respond to the changes of operational QoS metrics in their design of pricing schemes for various business objectives at different stages of network evolution. Our results show that a higher upload capacity can foster rational sharing to start when the network is small; however, it also discourages sharing behaviors when the network becomes large. In order to induce a socially optimal behavior, a pricing scheme will not charge users for requesting content while compensating them for sharing content. Such compensation is found to increase faster with the network size when the network is large. In order to maximize the profit of a monopolistic provider, however, a pricing scheme will charge content requests with a positive price while providing less compensation to sharing users compared to the socially optimal scheme. When the network size is small, such compensation can be even negative, which implies that a monopolistic provider discourages content sharing when the network is small, but encourages it when the network becomes larger. In addition, we find that more information about peer upload capacity discourages peers to share.",4,4

A fundamental but largely unanswered question in this nascent industry is the choice of market mechanisms, i.e., how the supply and demand of funds are matched, and the terms (price) at which transactions will occur. Two of the most popular mechanisms are auctions (where the “crowd” determines the price of the transaction through an auction process) and posted prices (where the platform determines the price). While P2P lending platforms typically use one or the other, there is little systematic research on the implications of such choices for market participants, transaction outcomes, and social welfare. We address this question both theoretically and empirically. We first develop a game-theoretic model that yields empirically testable hypotheses, taking into account the incentive of the platform. We then test these hypotheses by exploiting a regime change from auctions to posted prices on one of the largest P2P lending platforms. Consistent with our hypotheses, we find that under platform-mandated posted prices, loans are funded with higher probability, but the preset interest rates are higher than borrowers’ starting interest rates and contract interest rates in auctions. More important, all else equal, loans funded under posted prices are more likely to default, thereby undermining lenders’ returns on investment and their surplus. Although platform-mandated posted prices may be faster in originating loans, auctions that rely on the crowd to discover prices are not necessarily inferior in terms of overall social welfare.",4,5

These platforms may charge consumers prices and pay providers wages that both adjust based on prevailing demand conditions. For example, Uber uses a “surge pricing” policy, which pays providers a fixed commission of its dynamic price. With a stylized model that yields analytical and numerical results, we study several pricing schemes that could be implemented on a service platform, including surge pricing. We find that the optimal contract substantially increases the platform’s profit relative to contracts that have a fixed price or fixed wage (or both), and although surge pricing is not optimal, it generally achieves nearly the optimal profit. Despite its merits for the platform, surge pricing has been criticized because of concerns for the welfare of providers and consumers. In our model, as labor becomes more expensive, providers and consumers are better off with surge pricing because providers are better utilized and consumers benefit both from lower prices during normal demand and expanded access to service during peak demand. We conclude, in contrast to popular criticism, that all stakeholders can benefit from the use of surge pricing on a platform with self-scheduling capacity.",3,3

One way to ensure greater compliance is by electronically monitoring the activities of individuals, although such aggressive monitoring poses the risk of inducing backlash.

We did so using a unique, radio frequency identification (RFID)-based system deployed in 71 hospital units. We found that electronically monitoring individual compliance resulted in a large, positive increase in compliance. We also found that there was substantial variability in the effect across units and that units with higher levels of preactivation compliance experienced increased benefits from monitoring relative to units with lower levels of prepreactivation compliance. By observing compliance rates over three and a half years, we investigated the persistent effects of individual monitoring and found that compliance rates initially increased before they gradually declined. Additionally, in multiple units, individual monitoring was discontinued, allowing for an investigation of the impact of removing the intervention on compliance. Surprisingly, we found that, after removal, compliance rates declined to below prepreactivation levels.

In recent years, there has been growing interest from academics, policy-makers and practitioners on service innovation as a new business logic for companies to address societal challenges regarding sustainability. Nevertheless, research specifically focusing on service innovation in relation to sustainability is scarce and ultimately scattered across different research fields. Thereby, only limited clues are available for companies willing to address sustainability challenges through service innovation. To encourage further research in this direction, this paper systematically reviewed the available literature by investigating peer-reviewed publications (from 2004 up to and including 2015) across different fields, which jointly focus on services, innovation and sustainability. The literature review confirmed both the growing amount of research on service innovation in relation to sustainability, as well as the lack of an overarching field to clearly identify such a phenomenon. The review also revealed that three main existing research streams (service innovation, product-service system and sustainability-oriented innovation) contribute to the investigation topic, though all have specific focuses when it comes to the sustainability and innovation dimensions considered. Taking stock of the descriptive and thematic analysis of the review and the identified research gaps, the paper concludes by discussing the need for a clear recognition of the emerging field of sustainability-oriented service innovation, and by outlining several future research pathways for its further enhancement.

Missing from existing research is an analysis of the degree of novelty of service innovations introduced by manufacturing companies. Therefore, this article shifts the focus from the transition process itself to the question of how manufacturing companies can introduce radical service innovations to the market. This article links servitization literature with service innovation literature and investigates how manufacturing companies can introduce radically new services in terms of three forms of innovations: service concept innovations, customer experience innovations, and service process innovations. Service?dominant logic (SDL) is applied as the theoretical lens because it covers four significant factors influencing the success of companies’ innovation activities: actor value networks, resource liquefaction, resource density, and resource integration. Based on a multiple case study of 24 Danish business?to?business manufacturing small? and medium?sized enterprises and through a fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis, different configurations of the principles of SDL are analyzed. They describe the paths to radical service innovation. Digitalization appears as a central causal condition in the bulk of the configurations. Big and rich data generated internally within the focal company in combination with for instance customer data can enhance the innovativeness of the service offerings. However, digitalization is not a sufficient condition for launching radical service innovation—it should be combined with an efficient mobilization of resources internally within the focal company and/or collaboration with other organizations within the value system. In addition, the analysis hints to a need to detach from immediate customers as the prime driver of service innovation. ",2,2

IT tools are supposed to support internal and external information flows, thereby improving a firm's information processing capabilities. However, past research is indecisive about how IT tools influence innovation performance. Furthermore, past research has not considered that services have an increasingly relevant role in a firm's innovation portfolio that can complicate information processing. This study therefore draws on information processing theory and service innovation literature to develop a conceptual model that explains how IT use intensity—depending on the firm's business focus—affects innovation program performance. By using a cross?industry, multi?informant sample of the innovation programs of 116 firms, which were collected from 887 informants, this article provides empirical evidence that (i) intensive IT use in order to exchange information with internal and external stakeholders improves the firm?wide market knowledge, which in turn has a positive impact on a firm's innovation program performance; (ii) the performance impact of market knowledge becomes stronger with increasing degrees of servitization; (iii) a higher degree of servitization reduces IT's use intensity. This research demonstrates the dilemma that servitized firms face: Their business focus hinders the use of IT tools, although the latter will enable them to gain more benefits from the improved market knowledge they create. Practitioner Points: Intensive IT use positively influences the firm?wide innovation performance. The intensive use of IT tools to strengthen internal information flows and IT tools to support exchange with external stakeholders increase a firm's market knowledge, which enhances the innovation program performance. Service innovations have higher information requirements than product innovations and profit therefore more from intensive IT use, but services' complexity hinders IT implementation. Firms with a higher degree of servitization use less IT, although they can profit more from the market knowledge IT tools create. Servitized firms need to install a flexible, modular, and open IT system for efficient IT use and to include all relevant internal and external stakeholders. ",2,2

Based on the prior literature on servitization and firm operational capabilities, hypotheses were developed on the impact of service capabilities on firm performance. These hypotheses were tested using a survey and externally sourced financial data on 224 SMEs in the software industry. FO service capability has a positive impact on firm performance of SMEs. The effect of BO service capability was weaker and partly contrary to expectations, showing a negative effect on firm performance for young SMEs. As hypothesized, the impact of both BO and FO service capability is moderated by firm age. Young SMEs benefit more from FO service capability. For older SMEs, BO service capability becomes increasingly more important. As different capabilities lead to different outcomes, SMEs need to carefully consider which service capabilities to invest in. As the relative importance of capabilities changes over time, SMEs need to be ready to change their strategic focus over time toward BO capabilities to attain optimal outcomes. The  suggest that factors such as industry, firm size, and firm age affect the optimal servitization path, and that current understanding of servitization does not necessarily apply to all servitized firms.

During interviews, a payment card exercise measured risk perception and willingness to take strategic 'make-or-buy' decisions. Results suggest that implementing advanced services is perceived as a high-risk strategy, especially when firms lack in-house technological knowledge. However, collaborative strategic partnerships within supply chain networks can mitigate this risk and prove crucial to building entry barriers against external competitors.

The model shows how a new service can iteratively be developed through several improvement rounds into a final service, and each round increases the company’s understanding of customer value and capability to better integrate resources for this. Both the theoretical domain and the application of service-dominant logic can be extended with the lean service innovation approach introduced here.

We develop an analytical framework to examine the strategic and economic impact of product sharing among consumers. A consumer who purchased a firm’s product can derive different usage values across different usage periods. In a period with low self-use value, the consumer may generate some income by renting out her purchased product through a third-party sharing platform as long as the rental fee net of transaction costs exceeds her own self-use value. Our analysis shows that transaction costs in the sharing market have a nonmonotonic effect on the firm’s profits, consumer surplus, and social welfare. We find that when the firm strategically chooses its retail price, consumers’ sharing of products with high marginal costs is a win-win situation for the firm and the consumers, whereas their sharing of products with low marginal costs can be a lose-lose situation. Furthermore, in the presence of the sharing market, the firm will find it optimal to strategically increase its quality, leading to higher profits but lower consumer surplus.",4,5

They are both innovative services that base their success on customers controlling part of the service delivery. These providers allow service tasks to be performed by the customers as a means of shaping the overall experience and not strictly as a means of ""outsourcing"" the service. Motivated by such practices, we explore whether and how should providers allocate the control of different tasks of their service to the customers. We model services as multistep processes with each step affecting customers' experience at other steps. At certain steps the provider may hold an ""expert"" role and be more capable of performing than the customers, whereas at other steps she may hold an ""administrative"" role and be less capable of performing than the customers. We distinguish between routine services, where the service outcome must conform to standardized specifications, and non?routine services, where the value of the service outcome relies on subjective dimensions. We show that the optimal design is determined by an economically intuitive rule whereby the provider controls the steps based on the marginal benefit she can derive compared to self?service. For routine services, this rule translates to managing ""blocks"" of steps because the provider benefits from containing the volatility of the experiences across the service even when this implies the provision of service steps with a negative marginal benefit, that is, steps which she is less capable of performing than the customers. Instead, in non?routine services providers should focus on the value advantage they can ensure through a ""core provision"" even if this implies forgoing control of steps for which they are more capable of performing than the customers and from which they can derive positive marginal benefit. This implies that in non?routine services the provider exercises more control up to a certain process length; beyond that she delegates more steps to the customers. When customers differ in their abilities to perform the different steps, the provider may offer a service line. Service lines facilitate better segmentation than a single service offering, but their economic benefit exhibits an inverted ""U?shaped"" relationship with respect to the number of steps that a service comprises. Finally, we find that competition between two providers who differ in their capabilities to perform a service results in service design differentiation where the more capable provider offers a higher?end ""focused service"" against a lower?end ""super?service"" offered from the less capable provider.

Most traditional recommendation methods ignore the evolving characteristics of the cloud manufacturing service system and rely on initial static service descriptions. These descriptions are usually neither comprehensive nor pertinent in describing service application scenarios. To solve such issues, a novel method of Time-aware Targeted Reconstructing Service Descriptions (T-TRSD) is proposed in this paper. T-TRSD aims to reconstruct service descriptions by adding service composition descriptions. The evolving characteristics of services are also taken into consideration by the algorithm. This model complements the potential application scenarios of services, identifies the application scenario of the specific requirement and gives this scenario a higher weight. Based on service descriptions reconstructed by T-TRSD, a new manufacturing service recommendation strategy is offered. Comprehensive experiments show that this method brings a better recommendation performance. ",2,2

The service system consists of service facilities, each serving a set of allocated demand locations. The open facilities may be interrupted randomly because of a variety of facility?induced risk factors. The goal is to determine which service facilities are established, what service capacities are selected at open facilities, and how to assign the customers to the open facilities in order to maximize the system's overall performance. The problem is formulated as an integer nonlinear programming model and solved by a Lagrangian relaxation algorithm. The numerical experiments illustrate the high performance of the algorithm in large scales. Several managerial implications are also presented to show the effects of service interruption risks. ",4,5

However, competing strategically through service provision is becoming an important strategy for most industries. A growing demand for packaged product and service delivery is blurring the traditional boundaries between manufacturing and service firms. This trend is called ""servitization."" Prior research had different perspectives on the relationship between technological innovations and servitization. Some argued that as servitization exerts the innovative convergence of products and services, the possession of appropriate readiness and absorption capacity through technological innovations for a manufacturing firm is critical to the success of servitization. In contrast, some argued that the knowledge gained from developing technological innovations cannot be applied to the creation of services due to the fundamental difference between technology and service. These contradicting arguments motivated the authors to study the relationship between technological innovations and servitization a step further. The paper aims to discuss these issues. To address the research gap, the authors conducted an empirical study based on the large-scale samples from the second Taiwan Community Innovation Survey (Taiwan CIS). A multivariate logistic regression model was applied in the research. The authors found that different types of technological innovations, namely product innovation and process innovation, have different impacts on servitization. The innovativeness level of the technological innovation moderates the relationship between technological innovation and servitization. Based on the above findings, this research specifically explains the causes of the contradictory results of the prior research. The values of this research are twofold. Its academic contribution rests on bridging the literature of innovation and servitization, and on providing a model to clarify the relationships among technological innovation type, level of innovativeness and servitization. Its practical contribution lies in its establishment of a guideline that illuminates manufacturing firms reinforcing service delivery through their existing technological innovation trajectory. ",2,2

This value paradox frequently leads to unsustainable service systems. The of this paper is to explore the use of multiple theories to pinpoint and explain these value paradoxes, build a framework allowing potentially more sustainable value configuration of service systems and develop an agenda for future research. The framework is illustrated with examples from the hospitality industry. The paper draws on prevalent theories and approaches, including service-dominant logic, business modeling, transaction cost economics, stakeholder theory, configuration theory and set theory, to develop a value configuration framework. In a service system, the configuration of resources and relationships between these resources (i.e. the set of value propositions for various stakeholders of the system) determines which stakeholders will gain and which will lose and to what extent. For that reason, insight into the range of possible service configurations – or business models – will help decision makers consider the effects on various stakeholders, and, where possible, set their priorities right and make their businesses more sustainable. The research produces a rich research agenda.  Examples from hospitality allow an in-depth examination of a range of dynamic configurational and technological innovations, but some idiosyncratic characteristics of the context may impede the wider applicability of the conceptual framework. Future research could complement this work by studying other service sectors. Practical implications: The paper aims to provide decision makers in the service industry with a conceptual tool to explore, diagnose and, if needed, adjust the value configuration of their service operations. In practice, this tool may help explicate the service system configuration, thus helping managers determine their organizations' desired positioning in terms of value creation and destruction, and to choose strategic directions by adapting configurations. Legislation and regulations are being adapted to various new service configurations. This paper attempts to – at least conceptually – distinguish different service configurations, allowing policy makers to identify the value trade-offs between stakeholders, including society at large. Previous research focused primarily on value creation by innovative services and business models. Value creation for one stakeholder, However, could lead to value destruction for another. Taking this paradox into consideration may result in more open service ecosystems that explicitly consider sustainability and value implications in multiple dimensions and for a broader group of stakeholders.

Key findings highlight changes in motivations for consultancy engagement, from an initial focus on knowledge (output) to a focus on methodology (process). The adequacy of the framework proposed by Pinto et al (2016) is confirmed, and a new function of intermediaries arises from this study, related with “evaluation of innovation outcomes”. The study highlights the contribution of consultancies in preparing companies to innovate.",2,2

Production and Operations Management, 28(7), 1773-1791.","Online crowdfunding has emerged as a powerful tool to raise funds for emergency response. Crowdfunding campaigns can use two transparency tools to attract donors: updates and certification. Updates are additional messages that the organizer issues after launching the campaign and are a form of operational transparency when they communicate the campaign’s work to donors. Alternatively, certification is a form of conventional transparency that ensures the campaign truly benefits a charitable purpose. Using an econometric analysis, we investigate the effects of transparency on donations. We study the direction of causality and mechanisms behind work?related updates by conducting an experiment. Results from the econometric analysis using over 100,000 campaigns benefiting victims of emergencies reveal that both updates and certification have positive effects on donations. Each additional work?related word in an update (operational transparency) increases donations on average by $65 per month, while certification (conventional transparency) raises funds on average by $22 per month. Results from the experiment confirm the direction of causality; posting work?related updates in crowdfunding campaigns increases donations. Two mechanisms explain this effect: donors’ enhanced perceptions of effort and perceptions of trust.",3,3

Management Science, 65(2), 660-680.","Recently, online matching platforms (e.g., Craigslist, FreeCycle, Gumtree) have enabled consumers to directly connect with each other to buy/sell used consumer goods (electronics, furniture, packaging, etc.) that would have otherwise ended up in the waste stream. Such matching platforms can facilitate the creation of consumer-to-consumer (C2C) closed-loop supply chains (CLSCs) for used goods, which can enhance product reuse and limit reliance on recycling and disposal alternatives. Yet, the true environmental benefits of these internet-enabled C2C CLSCs remain to be ascertained. In this study, I use a quasi-experimental setup to examine how Craigslist’s entry into various U.S. geographic markets impacts a key environmental outcome: municipal solid waste (MSW). I assemble a data set from various disparate sources to test my hypothesis. I find that, on average, Craigslist’s entry into a geographic market results in a 2%–6% annual reduction in MSW per capita generated. I conduct a variety of robustness checks, falsification tests, and validation checks to provide support to my findings. Overall, this study provides deeper insights into the potential of online reuse platforms for the creation and coordination of C2C CLSCs. To my knowledge, this is the first study of closed-loop supply chains in a C2C context.",4,5

Management Science, 65(2), 477-493.","We describe an equilibrium model of peer-to-peer product sharing, or collaborative consumption, where individuals with varying usage levels make decisions about whether or not to own a homogeneous product. Owners are able to generate income from renting their products to nonowners while nonowners are able to access these products through renting on an as-needed basis. We characterize equilibrium outcomes, including ownership and usage levels, consumer surplus, and social welfare. We compare each outcome in systems with and without collaborative consumption and examine the impact of various problem parameters. Our findings indicate that collaborative consumption can result in either lower or higher ownership and usage levels, with higher ownership and usage levels more likely when the cost of ownership is high. Our findings also indicate that consumers always benefit from collaborative consumption, with individuals who, in the absence of collaborative consumption, are indifferent between owning and not owning benefitting the most. We study both profit-maximizing and social-welfare–maximizing platforms and compare equilibrium outcomes under both in terms of ownership, usage, and social welfare. We find that the difference in social welfare between the profit-maximizing and social-welfare–maximizing platforms is relatively modest.",4,5

Management Science, 65(5), 1995-2014.","On-demand platforms (e.g., Uber, Lyft) often rely on independent workers, who are not directly under the platform’s control, to be available at the “right” time and locations to serve consumers at short notice. To manage fluctuating demand across market locations (zones), on-demand platforms share market forecasts with workers to inform them where they should be available, and use surge pricing—wherein the price at a particular zone is temporarily raised above the regular price. We analyze these platform strategies in an on-demand marketplace where independent workers can move between adjacent zones, explicitly accounting for the strategic interaction in their moving decisions. We show that, contrary to conventional wisdom, surge pricing can be useful even in zones where supply exceeds demand. Specifically, because workers are strategic agents facing costs to move and competition from other workers who move, simply informing workers where they should be available may not ensure that enough workers move to that zone. Interestingly, more workers can be made to move from a zone with excess supply of workers by strategically using a surge price to throttle demand in that zone. Such strategic surge pricing can increase total platform profit across zones, and even be more profitable than offering workers bonuses to move. Surge pricing in a zone with excess supply can also be useful to credibly communicate the need for more workers to move. In other instances, such surge pricing may be useful to avoid too many workers from moving. Our analysis offers insights for effectively managing on-demand service with independentworkers.",4,5

Manufacturing & Service Operations Management, 21(2), 271-289.","In complex supply chains, the benefits and costs of technological innovations do not always accrue equitably to all parties; thus, their adoption may critically depend on sourcing relationships and incentives. In a setting with uncertain and endogenous process yield, we study the potential of two features—contract design and sourcing channel—to create mutual benefit in decentralized value chains, where suppliers bear the costs of new technologies while benefits accrue primarily to buyers. Our focus is on agricultural value chains, where parties may transact through a channel that blends farmers’ produce (“commodity-based channel”) or that allows a one-on-one interaction between farmer and processor (“direct-sourcing channel”). Our study provides insights to companies seeking to incorporate responsible sourcing strategies while also creating economic value—a concept called “creating shared value.” We identify that the technology’s “cost elasticity” drives whether switching sourcing channel, changing contract structure, or adopting an integrated change is necessary to create shared value. This highlights that value chain innovations need to be properly designed—and sometimes combined—to achieve sustainable implementation. We also find that certain simple contracts with a linear or bonus structure are optimal, while other intuitive contracts could be detrimental. Using a data set of farms in Patagonia, Argentina, we estimate that the proposed mechanism could increase average supply chain profit by 6.9% while realizing positive environmental benefits.",4,5

We use these applications to highlight distinguishing features of sharing economy business models and to point out research questions that are new. Then we draw connections between classical operations management theory and models and those that have been used to study sharing economy applications. We do so to put in context some of the recent work on the sharing economy and to showcase the underlying modeling toolkit and identify opportunities for future research.",2,2
286,2019,"Chen, Y., & Hu, M. (2019). Pricing and matching with forward-looking buyers and sellers. Manufacturing & Service Operations Management.","Problem definition: We study a dynamic market over a finite horizon for a single product or service in which buyers with private valuations and sellers with private supply costs arrive following Poisson processes. A single market-making intermediary decides dynamically on the ask and bid prices that will be posted to buyers and sellers, respectively, and on the matching decisions after buyers and sellers agree to buy and sell. Buyers and sellers can wait strategically for better prices after they arrive. Academic/practical relevance: This problem is motivated by the emerging sharing economy and directly speaks to the core of operations management that is about matching supply with demand. Methodology: The dynamic, stochastic, and game-theoretic nature makes the problem intractable. We employ the mechanism-design methodology to establish a tractable upper bound on the optimal profit, which motivates a simple heuristic policy. Results: Our heuristic policy is: fixed ask and bid prices plus price adjustments as compensation for waiting costs, in conjunction with the greedy matching policy on a first-come-first-served basis. These fixed base prices balance demand and supply in expectation and can be computed efficiently. The waiting-compensated price processes are time-dependent and tend to have opposite trends at the beginning and end of the horizon. Under this heuristic policy, forward-looking buyers and sellers behave myopically. This policy is shown to be asymptotically optimal. Managerial implications: Our results suggest that the intermediary might not lose much optimality by maintaining stable prices unless the underlying market conditions have significantly changed, not to mention that frequent surge pricing may antagonize riders and induce riders and drivers to behave strategically in ways that are hard to account for with traditional pricing models.",4,5
287,2019,"Li, H., & Srinivasan, K. (2019). Competitive dynamics in the sharing economy: an analysis in the context of Airbnb and hotels. Marketing Science, 38(3), 365-391.","The entry of flexible-capacity sharing economy platforms (e.g., Airbnb and Uber) has potentially changed the competitive landscape in traditional industries with fixed-capacity incumbents and volatile demand. Leveraging panel data on hotels and Airbnb, we study how the sharing economy fundamentally changes the way the industry accommodates demand fluctuations and how incumbent firms should strategically respond. The demand estimates suggest that Airbnb’s flexible supply helps recover the lost underlying demand due to hotel seasonal pricing (i.e., higher prices during high-demand seasons) and even stimulates more demand in some cities. The counterfactual results suggest that some hotel types in some cities may benefit from conducting less seasonal pricing and even considering counter-seasonal pricing. Market conditions (e.g., seasonality patterns, hotel prices and quality, consumer composition, and Airbnb supply elasticity) play a crucial role in determining the impact of Airbnb on hotel sales and hotels’ strategic response. Finally, recent Airbnb and policy changes (e.g., higher Airbnb hosting costs due to hotel taxes or lower Airbnb hosting costs due to third-party services and the “professionalism” of hosts) affect the competitive dynamics. The profits of high-end hotels are the most sensitive to the changes in Airbnb hosting costs. Airbnb’s recent attempt to behave more like hotels can increase hotels’ vulnerability to lower Airbnb hosting costs.",4,5

Management Science.","Recent research has found widespread discrimination by hosts against guests of certain races in online marketplaces. In this paper, we explore ways to reduce such discrimination using online reputation systems. We conducted four randomized field experiments among 1,801 hosts on Airbnb by creating fictitious guest accounts and sending accommodation requests to them. We find that requests from guests with African American–sounding names are 19.2 percentage points less likely to be accepted than those with white-sounding names. However, a positive review posted on a guest’s page significantly reduces discrimination: when guest accounts receive a positive review, the acceptance rates of guest accounts with white- and African American–sounding names are statistically indistinguishable. We further show that a nonpositive review and a blank review without any content can also help attenuate discrimination, but self-claimed information on tidiness and friendliness cannot reduce discrimination, which indicates the importance of encouraging credible peer-generated reviews. Our results offer direct and clear guidance for sharing-economy platforms to reduce discrimination.",4,5

To mitigate this problem, regulators scrutinize project operations. We study the effect of oversight on delays and overruns with 262,857 projects spanning 71 federal agencies and 54,739 contractors. We identify our results using a federal bylaw: if the project’s budget is above a cutoff, procurement officers actively oversee the contractor’s operations; otherwise, most operational checks are waived. We find that oversight increases delays by 6.1%–13.8% and overruns by 1.4%–1.6%. We also show that oversight is most obstructive when the contractor has no experience in public projects, is paid with a fixed-fee contract with performance-based incentives, or performs a labor-intensive task. Oversight is least obstructive—or even beneficial—when the contractor is experienced, paid with a time-and-materials contract, or conducts a machine-intensive task.",4,5

Decision Sciences.","The IT?enabled sharing economy has enabled the taxi to become an Internet product, forming a popular new phenomenon in people's daily lives and creating new roles for employees. How the Internet taxi drivers’ work engagement is influenced in the context of the IT?enabled sharing economy has become an interesting new area for IS researchers to explore. Although monetary rewards are important for employees’ behavior and performance, extant studies primarily emphasize the crowding?out and crowding?in effects of financial incentives, rather than the influencing mechanism. This article prospects and develops theoretically the effects of monetary rewards and workplace spirituality on work engagement and demonstrates these effects empirically. An analysis of 35 semistructured interviews revealed three intrinsic motivators: stress reduction, job autonomy, and self?efficacy. We propose a structural model based upon motivation crowding theory. Responses to 235 survey responses showed that work engagement can be improved by providing monetary rewards and enhancing workplace spirituality through intrinsic motivators. This research contributes to exploring the mediating role of intrinsic motivators, extends motivation crowding theory to a new research field, and provides a new perspective on work engagement in the context of the IT?enabled sharing economy. Our findings extend the previous research associated with workplace spirituality and the existing knowledge of operations management from the perspective of labor intensity and trade?off between inputs and outputs.",2,2

Journal of Service Research, 22(3), 256-271.","Although access-based services (ABS) offer many benefits, convincing consumers to use these service innovations remains challenging. Research suggests that contamination concerns are an important barrier to consumer adoption of ABS; they arise when a person believes someone else has touched an object and transferred residue or germs. However, systematic examination of this phenomenon is lacking. We conduct four experiments to determine (1) the impact of contamination concerns on consumer evaluations of ABS, (2) when such concerns become salient in ABS, and (3) how ABS providers can reduce these concerns. The results reveal that consumers experience more contamination concerns about objects used in proximity to their bodies, especially when those objects are shared with unfamiliar users, and that such concerns negatively influence their evaluations of ABS. Consumers also exhibit less contamination concerns about ABS that have high brand equity because of their elevated stereotype-related perceptions of the competence of those users. Firms’ advertisements depicting physical contact between shared objects and other users negatively influence ABS evaluations by consumers whose contamination concept is activated. This article provides insights for developing product, branding, and communication strategies to reduce consumers’ contamination concerns and maximize ABS adoption.",4,5

Production and Operations Management.","Manufacturers moving into services must design a service delivery system that can effectively and efficiently support their product?service offerings. Commonly, such manufacturers outsource customer service and support to independent service suppliers, while maintaining the ownership and control of certain service units. Despite the increasing number of studies in service triads investigating ways that may improve service performance and customer satisfaction, the dynamics of mixed?ownership service delivery systems have remained understudied. By deploying the Motivation–Opportunity–Ability (MOA) framework, and synthesizing insights from research in franchising and the literature on training effectiveness, we hypothesize that manufacturer?led formal training increases the service performance of the entire network, but that outsourced service units choose more suitable training courses and derive comparatively higher performance benefits than company?owned ones. We test (and find support for) our hypotheses within the UK service network of a major commercial vehicles manufacturer, using several panel data regression models and objective measures of training and performance. This study primarily contributes to the literature on servitization and service triads by showing the performance?enhancing capacity of manufacturer?led training. The results have practical implications for the development and implementation of the service operations strategy of servitized manufacturers that support customers through mixed?ownership service networks.",4,5
